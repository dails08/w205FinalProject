order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

Standards and Practices Panel   RTO Week   <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  Day 4 - October 18, 2001  Afternoon Session     Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices   Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.      General Observations      The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions.       FERC Deliverables   A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.    The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.  The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.  The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.    One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:   ·         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?   ·         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are allowed)?    ·         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?   ·         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?   ·         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?   ·         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?   ·         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?   ·         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?   Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financial hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.  Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.   NERC and GISB   A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.  Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.  Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.  There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.  The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.  Let me know if you have any questions.

It is the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our walk with God.  The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely weighted to the knowledge side. The apostle Peter tells us there is a solution to this dilemma.  For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).  Is your Christian experience filled with knowledge, but little power? Is there a staleness in your walk with God? Is there an unrest in your soul? It may be due to a need to develop character that only the Holy Spirit can develop out of an obedient heart. Ask the Lord today to add these qualities to your faith so that you can be productive as a soldier of Jesus Christ.

These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might . . . (Ephesians 1:19).  In Ephesians 1:19-21, Paul gives us a peek at the dynamic source of our authority in Christ. He explains that the authority at our disposal flows from the reservoir of power which raised Jesus Christ from the dead and seated Him at the Father's right hand. That power source is so dynamic that Paul used four different Greek words in verse 19 to describe it: power (dunameos), working (energeian), strength (kratous), and might (ischuos). Behind the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ lies the mightiest work of power recorded in the Word of God. And the same power which raised Christ from the dead and defeated Satan is the power available to us to overcome the works of Satan in our daily lives.  Paul opens our eyes to the expansive scope of Christ's authority which is "far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come" (Ephesians 1:21). Think about the most powerful and influential political or military leaders in the world. Imagine the most feared terrorists, crime kingpins and drug barons. Think about Satan and all the power of darkness marshaled under his command. Jesus' authority is not only above all these human and spiritual authorities past, present and future, but He is far above them. We share the same position because we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies, which enable us to live in freedom and victory over demonic intrusion and influence.  Don't be deceived. You are not under Satan's power or subject to his authority. You are in Christ above all demonic rule, authority and power.  Reigning with You, Lord--what a liberating thought! I praise You today for the power You share with me.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Neil Anderson at < http://www.ficm.org >.

MRG as BCTL, a public company, has greater access to capital and to registered securities to assist in future acquisitions and expansion.  MRG today announced they have increased their space 3 times. Watch for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.  Military Market Segment Is Hot. Xcel Associates'  target is $3.00.   MRG TRIPLES WAREHOUSE SPACE IN ANTICIPATION OF CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 16, 2001--Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) is pleased to announce it has moved from its previous 12,000-square-foot warehouse to one containing almost 33,000 square feet.  This move will allow the Company to approximately triple its dry space, double its cooler space and triple its freezer space. Ethan D. Hokit, President, stated that ``many household name companies have requested that we begin to service their accounts in our current market. Consequently, we continue our planned multiphase expansion to serve the Military Resale Market. Military Resale Group, Inc. is negotiating with several companies to obtain new business and anticipates showing continued growth in sales, which the new warehouse would accommodate.''  In 1999, Military Resale Group, Inc. was housed in a 2,500- square-foot warehouse and a few months later acquired another 2,000 square feet. In October 1999, the Company acquired another 7,500 square feet, bringing its total to 12,000 square feet. This space was adequate until a few months ago, when it became evident that more warehouse space was needed to support the growth that the Company is experiencing.  Military Resale Group, Inc. (MRG) was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military Resale Market. At that time MRG's annual sales were $750,000, and they have since soared five-fold in three years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now a publicly owned company as a result of its recent acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).  The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market, with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The competitive structure of the Military Resale Market consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post- acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by internal growth.

The contrast between bondage and freedom in a believer's life is beautifully illustrated in the following letter from a successful professional man.      Dear Neil:      My emotional troubles were probably rooted in my childhood     experiences with horror movies, Ouija boards, etc. I clearly     remember fearing a visit from devilish forces after I saw the     movie titled The Blood of Dracula.      My father had a pretty hot temper and was given to emotional     outbursts. My survival response was to sulk and blame myself     for upsetting him. Bottling my emotions inside became a way     of life. As I grew into adulthood, I continued to blame     myself for any and all personal shortcomings and misfortunes.      Then I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. I grew     spiritually over the next several years, but I never enjoyed     complete peace. There was always a lingering doubt about my     relationship with God whom I saw as distant and stern. I had     difficulty praying, reading the Bible and paying attention to     the pastor's sermons. I seriously questioned the purpose of     life. I experienced horrible nightmares which woke me up     screaming.      It was during my time of prayer with you that I finally found     freedom in Christ. Now when I read God's Word, I understand     it like never before. I have developed a more positive     attitude, and my entire relationship with my Lord has     completely changed. Since our meeting, I haven't had one     nightmare.  I'm not saying that every spiritual problem is the result of direct demonic activity. But you may be in bondage because you have overlooked or denied the reality of demonic powers at work in the world. Your inheritance in Christ is the basis for your complete freedom promised in Scripture.  Help me not to be a spiritual ostrich today, but to be alert to my enemy's tactics and to Your truth.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The temple lay in ruins, and the Lord spoke to the prophet Haggai, "Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?" (Hag. 1:4) God was calling for a remnant of His people to come out of their comfort zones and restore the glory of God's house.  God is doing this same thing today among Christian businesspeople throughout the world. He is raising up a remnant of businesspeople who are being handpicked to use their resources, skills, and experience to affect nations that have not heard the message of Jesus Christ. The only way they can hear is by commerce being brought into their nation through Christian businesspeople, because these are closed regions to normal missionary efforts.  "But now be strong, O Zerubbabel," declares the Lord. "Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land," declares the Lord, "and work. For I am with you," declares the Lord Almighty. "This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you. Do not fear" (Haggai 2:4-5).  The remnant of businesspeople God is calling today understand that they have to come out of Egypt from their past business life. Egypt signifies the way of the world. It represents sweat and toil. It is the flesh. This new way is exemplified by a pioneer spirit. God knows we need to have courage in order to move in this realm. Also, God assures us that His Spirit is with anyone who seeks to live in the realm of supernatural faith.  Are you one of these remnants He has handpicked in these days? Has He called you out of Egypt in order to do extraordinary things in your life for His Kingdom? Ask God to show you how He wants to use you in the marketplace this year. Then act and "be strong, all you people of the land."     Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

That is exactly what happened to David. David made what might appear to be an innocent request of his general, Joab. But the minute Joab heard the request, he cringed. He knew David was in big trouble for this one. You see, to number the troops was a great sin in Israel because it was against the law. Why? Because it demonstrated that you were placing more trust in numbers than in the living God. David displayed enough pride to cost the lives of 70,000 fighting men. God gave him three choices of punishment for his sin. A plague was the one he chose, and it resulted in the loss of 70,000.  Throughout Israel's history, God set the stage for battles to be won, miracles to take place, and people to exercise faith. The stage was always set so that man could not take credit for what God did. Consider Gideon who was only allowed 300 men to fight an army of 100,000. Consider Jehoshaphat, who had to lead his army with his singers. God defeated the enemy. Consider Joshua, who was told simply to walk around Jericho seven times, and they would get victory. God did things in some very unconventional ways!  How does this relate to you and me as businesspeople? Well, the minute you and I place more trust in our abilities than in God, we are guilty of numbering the troops. How does He punish us? Sometimes it's through letting a deal go sour. Sometimes it's through problems with a client or vendor. Sometimes situations just blow up in our face. Other times, He lets us go on for a long time doing our own thing, but eventually He deals with it.  The lesson here is to learn daily and complete dependence on God. Use your gifts and abilities through the power of the Holy Spirit. Ask Him daily for direction and wisdom. His ways won't always line up with conventional wisdom. When we begin depending on our abilities only, God has a responsibility to make known to us who is the giver of the blessings.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * *  What are the hindrances that keep you and I from living fully for Christ?

MILITARY RESALE GROUP as BCTL, a public company, now has greater access to capital. MILITARY RESALE GROUP last week announced they have increased their space 3 times. Watch for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.  Military Market Segment Is Hot.   MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS PRODUCT LINE  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid industry, has been added to its product supplier network.  Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000 annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.  President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group is pleased and complimented to have become able to represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our distribution activities. We have previously forecast that we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000 to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new presence is expected to make a major contribution to this $1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''  Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were $750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now a publicly owned company as a result of its recent acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).  The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market, with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The competitive structure of the Military Resale Market consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post- acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by internal growth.

One Panel X-SDOC: 778292 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-341.eml    . -----Original Message----- From: Novosel, Sarah  Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 10:29 PM To: Presto, Kevin M.; Davis, Mark Dana; May, Tom; Will, Lloyd; Lindberg, Susan; Gupta, Gautam; Misra, Narsimha; Scheuer, Janelle; Baughman, Edward D.; Herndon, Rogers Cc: Nicolay, Christi L. Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel   Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.    Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).    Energy Spot Market  There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.    Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules  Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.  ICAP Requirement  Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).    Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.   Standardized Markets   Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.  Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.  Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets  The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).  This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.  Mandatory Markets  Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.   ICAP   Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.  Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.  Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.  Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.  I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives.   Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for "EPMI 24-Hour Operations," with a login of "Enron."  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.  This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.  If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

The moral fiber of our world has eroded. Greed, idolatry, and pleasure are the gods of our day. And it is no different in the Body of Christ.  The prophet Haggai wrote about a people who had lost concern for the need to build God's house because they were so focused on their own worldly needs. It is a dangerous place to get with God. When our world begins to focus around increasing our pleasure, building bigger and better homes, and failing to make what is important to God important in our own lives, this should be a warning to us.  Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. "It is written," He said to them, " 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers' " (Matthew. 21:12-13).  Jesus came into Jerusalem and found the businesspeople buying and selling in the temple. As far as they knew, this was an acceptable practice in their day. Their fathers did it, and now they were doing it. It was business as usual. Jesus got angry, turned over the tables, and said that His house was a house of prayer. He found the businesspeople of the day seeing His house as a place for profit, not prayer. They had stepped into a place of complacency that was not acceptable to the Lord. When we begin to blend in with the moral condition of an ungodly world, we begin losing God's perspective on life.  It is easy to begin blending in with our culture and to accept what is being modeled by the ungodly. God called us to be salt in a world that needs much salt. "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men" (Mt. 5:13). Each of us must ask ourselves if we have lost our salt. Are we having an impact on our world? Or is our world having an impact on us? Ask God to give you a vision for how you can be salt to your world today.     Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 06:00:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Crosswalk.com <marketplace@lists.crosswalk.com> To: jeff.king@enron.com Subject: TGIF Marketplace Meditation -- The Door of Full Surrender X-SDOC: 940862 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-432.eml  T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T Marketplace Meditations by Os Hillman  The Door of Full Surrender  But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold. - (Job 23:10)   I was recently sitting with the leader of a marketplace organization as he described a question he poses to businesspeople. "What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance. "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Cor. 4:17).     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

A mentor is one who takes responsibility for the spiritual and, sometimes, physical care of another. It requires a commitment from the teacher and the student.  Elijah mentored Elisha. Elisha became one of the greatest prophets in all the Bible. One of the primary reasons for this was Elisha's hunger. Elisha wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit. It was this hunger that drove Elisha to be sold out to God's purposes for his life.  I have been privileged to have had many mentors throughout my spiritual life. In each stage of my maturity, God brought new mentors who had unique gifts that the previous mentor did not have. God has given me the hunger to desire a double portion of those positive attributes of my mentors. This desire is sorely missing among many today. I fail to see the hunger among many who could be used greatly in the Kingdom. Instead, they get distracted by the cares of this world. It is an attitude of a la carte versus an attitude of pressing in to the full measure of what God might have for them.  Who are the people of God He has placed in your life? Are you learning from them? Are you seeking a double portion of their anointing? What prevents you from gaining from their wisdom and experience? God may have brought them into your life to prepare you to be a man or woman of God with great anointing. However, there is a time of training and waiting to prove out your own faith. Ask God today if there is someone He would have you mentor or be mentored by.

"What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance. "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Cor. 4:17).     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Fri, 26 Oct 2001 07:32:13 +0200 (CEST) Subject: TERRA SYSTEMS From: POWER STOCKS AMERICA powerstocksamerica@crmems.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-+22POWER+20STOCKS+20AMERICA+22+20+3Cpowerstocksamerica+40crmems+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com> To: King  Jeff <Jeff.King@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 778183 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-232.eml  TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI) Latest price: 30 cents   Take a close look at TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI) - latest price: 30 cents - which has just released the following news.  The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60 cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1 reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 - $6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The whole transaction took less than a year.   TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP  PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.  The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites certain caveats including that ``...these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by TSYI....''  The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In conclusion, the process and its potential application to utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''  Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization, including those mentioned in this report. But, we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''  Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is presently a development-stage company. It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state, using air as the medium of movement. This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials. Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry-process technology. This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures, including: drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction, Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation, agriculture, mining, environment, construction, ceramics, and materials transportation. We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years, if adopted for implementation in several large projects. Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18 million shares currently outstanding.

Christ often compared this process to building a house. First, we must prepare to build by laying a foundation. That foundation is none other than Jesus Christ Himself. Any foundation other than Christ will not stand.  Second, as we enter a walk of faith with God, He allows each of us to experience trials, testings, miracles, and challenges in life that are designed to provide "faith experiences" that demonstrate tangible evidences of His work in our life: Moses' burning-bush experience, Peter's walk on the water, Joshua's parting of the Jordan River. These experiences built the faith of these people. The depth and width of our calling is directly proportional to the faith experiences He allows in each of our lives. If God plans an international ministry with you, chances are you will experience a higher degree of faith experiences compared to another. The reason is, you will need to look on these to ensure your calling and provide testimony to His work in your life.  The third stage deals with motives. "All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord" (Prov. 16:2). What is the motive behind my actions? Is it only financial accumulation? Is it to gain control? Is it to create independence? The primary motive must be God's leading you to take such an action-it must be obedience. These other factors must be by-products of the decision.  Finally, we are prepared to take action. Here we must ask, "Do we have the skill, quality, and ability to enter into this activity?" So often we have not trained ourselves adequately to be successful in our endeavor. You would never want someone working on your teeth who had not been trained and certified as a dentist.  Before you begin your next project, ask yourself these four questions. What is the foundation this project is based on? What experiences has God demonstrated in my life that indicate His involvement? What is my motive for entering this activity? Do I have the skill, quality, and ability to accomplish the task? Answering these questions will tell you whether God will bless your activity.  * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * * * * * *  Get your year started right.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.  2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.  PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.  HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.  After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Perhaps you may feel that you are more skilled than any other in your field. Does God need your skills and abilities in order to accomplish His purposes on this earth? The answer is NO.  One thing God does not need is our skills and abilities. However, He does give us the privilege to exercise our gifts and abilities for His service. That service may be as a computer technician, a secretary, an ironworker, or even a lawyer. God calls each of us to our vocations to work unto Him. To believe that He needs our skills to accomplish His mission on earth would be to lower our understanding of an all-encompassing and all-powerful God. The psalmist tells us that His pleasure is not in our strength and ability, but His pleasure is in the attitude of the heart. It is what we find in the heart that helps determine whether ability is translated into availability. You see, God is looking to and fro throughout the earth for a man or woman who is fully committed to Him. A man or woman who is committed to fearing the Lord and placing his hope in His unfailing love is the person God seeks to support. "For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him" (2 Chron. 16:9a). When our agenda becomes His agenda, we can expect God to fully support all that we do.  If we want to see our skills and abilities multiplied a hundredfold, then we must make them completely available to His service. Where are the opportunities in which God is calling you to be available to Him? Next time someone asks you to be involved in some activity, before you say yea or nay, make sure you check in with the Master of our decisions to ensure that your gifts and talents are being used as He desires.

RUFF I, Larry E. Ruff, being duly sworn, depose and say as follows:  INTRODUCTION  BACKGROUND I am currently an independent consultant specializing in the economics of competitive electricity markets.  My business address is 1221 Jones St., #A4, San Francisco, CA, 94109.  I have been asked by Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services, Inc., (collectively, “Enron”) to provide my views on the appropriate way to assure sufficient capacity reserves in a competitive electricity market, and in particular to comment on the need for a capacity payment or installed capacity (ICAP) requirement separate from the requirement to pay market prices for energy and ancillary services including operating reserves. My professional résumé is attached.  In summary, I have over thirty years experience in academia, government, industry and consulting as an energy and environmental economist and policy advisor.  For the fourteen years prior to May 2000, when I became an independent consultant, I was a Senior Vice President with National Economic Research Associates (NERA) and a Managing Director (and other titles) at Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett Inc. (PHB).  During that period I specialized in the design and operations of competitive electricity markets in the United States and abroad. I lived and worked in London during, and played a major intellectual role in, the development of the England and Wales Pool, the first competitive electricity market based on an open pool or spot market.  I subsequently led market design projects in Victoria and New South Wales (Australia), India, Thailand and Ontario (Canada) and was closely involved in the design, revision and/or operation of the electricity markets in New Zealand, Argentina, Peru, Alberta (Canada), and Spain.  In the United States, I have testified before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC” or “the Commission”) on gas and electricity transmission pricing and market design issues, have testified before many state regulatory commissions on demand-side management programs and other matters, and have advised parties in many states regarding competitive electricity markets.  I speak and write widely on these issues. On the specific matter of capacity payments and requirements, I have submitted testimony on behalf of Enron and others to the Commission’s NEPOOL ICAP proceeding (Docket No. EL00-62-005).  This current affidavit is totally consistent with, and even contains many of the same arguments as, my affidavits in the NEPOOL ICAP proceeding.  PURPOSE AND SUMMARY The purpose of this affidavit is to provide my views on the appropriate way to assure sufficient capacity reserves in a competitive electricity market, and in particular to comment on the need for a capacity payment or installed capacity (ICAP) requirement separate from the requirement to pay market prices for energy and ancillary services (E&AS, defined to include the various types of operating reserves needed for reliable real-time operations). In summary, my basic conclusion is that the key to assuring adequate capacity – or, more accurately, reliability – is to permit/require the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) to operate efficient real-time spot markets in E&AS that always “clear,” in the sense that the pricing mechanism is able and is allowed to determine prices that equate demand to supply for each E&AS at all times.  If this is done, then, virtually by definition:  the RTO will always have all the E&AS resources it needs to assure that demand is met reliably; all market participants will see price signals that accurately reflect the real system costs and benefits resulting from their physical actions; and all suppliers will be adequately compensated for providing the E&AS services that have real value for reliability. Systems in which the RTO pays for, or requires load-serving entities (LSEs) to pay for, something called “capacity” as opposed to real-time E&AS are essentially ways to tax loads and use the proceeds to subsidize “capacity” to stand around in case it is needed.  Such tax/subsidy devices continue the regulatory practice of creating excess capacity as a public good that keeps wholesale E&AS spot prices for all suppliers (but not retail prices to final consumers, which must cover the costs of the capacity subsidy as well as the E&AS payments) lower and more stable on average than they would be in an efficient market.  Such devices are at best an inefficient way to maintain reliability, because they both:  pay generators for something other than providing real E&AS when and where these have value for reliability; and drive a tax wedge between the retail prices paid by loads and the prices paid to generators In practice, such devices require the RTO to make many detailed decisions about what kind of capacity qualifies for how much of the capacity subsidy, how capacity performance will be measured and non-performance penalized, which LSEs should pay what share of the capacity taxes, etc.  And they embroil the Commission in interminable disputes about all such matters.  Any system that gives the monopoly RTO such control over the market and requires so much regulatory intervention is ultimately incompatible with effective and efficient competition. Concerns about reliability and price stability in current or planned RTO markets should be addressed by assuring that RTOs operate efficient E&AS spot markets that always clear, and that market participants who do not want to be exposed to the volatility of spot prices are protected by contracts that they choose for themselves or, for consumers who are unable to contract for themselves, that are provided by regulated suppliers.  If the Commission decides that capacity tax-subsidy arrangements are necessary while RTO spot markets are poorly developed and their results not fully accepted, the Commission should make it clear that these are acceptable only as transitional devices with a specific sunset date, e.g., for two years after creation of an RTO.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS AFFIDAVIT The balance of this affidavit consists of the following three sections:  Section 2:  The Concept of “Capacity”, discusses why the concept of capacity as a commodity separate from energy and ancillary services was useful in regulated monopoly pools and why it is not useful or constructive in a competitive electricity market. Section 3:  Installed Capacity Obligations, discusses the logic and effects of ICAP regimes that require load-serving entities to contract for enough capacity to cover their own loads. Section 4:  Conclusions and Recommendations, provides a brief restatement of my conclusions and recommendations for the Commission.    THE  CONCEPT  OF  “CAPACITY”   The concept of “capacity” as a commodity separate from energy and ancillary services was invented for regulated monopoly planning and power pooling processes.  It is unnecessary and counterproductive in, and is fundamentally inconsistent with, a competitive electricity market.  “CAPACITY” PLAYED A USEFUL ROLE IN MONOPOLY UTILITY SYSTEMS Advocates of capacity payments and/or obligations correctly point out that the concept of capacity as a separate commodity has a long and honorable tradition in monopoly utility planning, and that capacity obligations have long been used in the tight capacity-sharing power pools of the northeast United States and elsewhere.  But the planning methods used by such utilities, and the transfer pricing methods used in their power pools, have few parallels in competitive markets in general and are not needed or constructive in a well-designed competitive electricity market.  A Monopoly Pool is Not a Market Power pools formed by regulated monopoly utilities are not markets in which the prices of E&AS are determined by supply and demand, but are capacity-sharing and cost-sharing arrangements in which transfer payments among pool members are based on readily observable costs.  Such pools began historically on the premise that each pool member would bring to the pool enough capacity to cover its own loads with a reserve margin, and then the pool would dispatch total pool capacity to minimize the total short-run cost of meeting total pool load and allocate the total short-run costs among pool members on some split-the-savings basis.  Over time, the complex split-the-savings calculations evolved towards payments for E&AS at transfer prices based on easily observable short-run costs, but these transfer prices were never intended to cover the full costs of the capacity each member was required to bring to the pool.  Capacity was traded and priced among pool members as a commodity separate from the E&AS it produced, and had value because capacity was essentially a “ticket” one needed to buy E&AS from the pool at less than its full long-run cost. If one begins with the premise that each buyer from the pool will make available to the pool enough capacity to produce what that buyer buys, it is only natural to define the transfer prices for E&AS in terms of the readily-observable variable costs of producing each such service once the capacity is available.  For energy, the obvious transfer price is the variable energy cost (fuel costs plus variable O&M costs) of the highest-energy-cost unit running during the pricing/settlement interval or “hour” during which energy is being exchanged.  Most ancillary services, including operating reserves and reactive power, cost little or nothing to provide once the capacity is available, so the obvious transfer prices for these services are very low or zero.  It does not matter that E&AS transfer prices determined in this manner will not cover total capacity costs if each buyer at these prices must provide and/or pay for enough capacity to produce the E&AS it buys. The pricing and cost allocation rules outlined above are logical enough in a strict mathematical sense, and can even more-or-less “work” in a world of monopoly utilities in which all information is available to the central planner/price setter and all participants have legal obligations to do as they are told largely without regard to the immediate cost implications.  Even here, however, it is very difficult to define and enforce the obligation that each buyer from the pool provide or pay for enough “capacity” to produce what it buys.  Each pool member has incentives to cut its own costs by providing too little capacity and/or providing cheap capacity that does not produce actual E&AS as reliably as and where it should.  So the pool operator make and enforce many judgmental and often arbitrary decisions regarding the standards that a machine must meet in order to qualify as “capacity,” the mix of E&AS each machine must be capable of providing, the amount of “capacity” provided by machines with the same MW number on the nameplate but very different characteristics (e.g., hydro and thermal plants), the penalties for failure of capacity to provide E&AS when called to do so, the amount and characteristics of capacity each buyer must provide based on its actual buys, and the penalties on a buyer for failure to provide the required capacity. There really is no practical way for a pool operator to define and enforce all of the above standards and penalties in an efficient way.  But as long as all pool members are in the same club of regulated utilities who have the right to recover all prudent costs from captive customers, the cost and competitive implications of these decisions are not critical; the only critical thing is that each pool member’s regulators deem the resulting costs and their allocations to be “prudent.”  Unfortunately, what is acceptable in a cost-based pool of cooperating, regulated monopolies is not acceptable in a market composed of unregulated, profit-seeking competitors.  The “Value of Capacity” Is NOT (Usually) the “Cost of a Peaker” Capacity has value in a cost-based pool because the transfer prices for the E&AS produced by capacity are significantly below the true value of those E&AS, particularly during periods when demand is high or (more correctly) when capacity is scarce relative to demand for any reason, such as generating plant failures.  Because the transfer prices of ancillary services (including reserves) are usually small or zero and the transfer price of energy is equal to the pool’s incremental energy cost or “system lambda,” during such critical periods total payments to capacity are determined by the variable energy costs of the generating unit with the highest variable energy cost – so-called “pure capacity” and usually assumed to be a combustion turbine (CT) – and the amount of energy that is actually being generated.  The difference between the true value of all the E&AS provided by capacity (including the capacity providing uncompensated ancillary services rather than energy) and the energy payments at incremental-cost transfer payments is the true value of capacity.  Figure 1: The Value of Capacity in a Cost - Regulated Pool True Value of E&AS Time $/MWh Energy Transfer Price (“System Lambda”) Value of “Pure” Capacity EP CT    Figure 1 illustrates the above logic.  The true value of E&AS in each hour is the incremental cost of supplying E&AS or, during critical periods, of reducing demand or taking other costly actions (e.g., running risks by reducing operating reserves or voltage), so that demand can be met reliably.  But if the pool pays only for energy at system lambda, pool transfer payments for E&AS will be less than the true value of E&AS, both because ancillary services are not being compensated and because the energy transfer prices is limited by the incremental energy cost of a CT (EPCT in Figure 1) even though the value of incremental energy can be much higher during critical periods when costly demand-side and emergency operational measures are needed to keep the lights on.  The difference in each hour between the true value of E&AS and the energy transfer price is the value of “pure” capacity for that hour.  The hourly values can be added across some period such as a month or a year to get the value of capacity over that period. It is a well known result from utility planning theory that, if the transfer price of energy in a pool is set at the pool’s incremental energy cost (or system lambda) and all generating capacity receives an additional annual payment equal to the annualized carrying cost of a CT, each generating unit will just cover its full operating and capacity costs – provided that a CT sets the highest energy price, the system has the optimal amount and mix of capacity given system demand for that year, each year is just like the previous and the succeeding years, there is no technical change or economies of scale, etc.  This theoretical result is often interpreted to mean that the value of capacity is everywhere and always equal to the carrying cost of a CT.  But given the many simplifying assumptions needed to obtain this theoretical result, such an interpretation is incorrect.  At most, this result means that, in a well-planned and well-run cost-based pool, there is some tendency for the average value of capacity over a long period of time to approximate or tend towards the ever-changing costs of whatever it is that sets the energy price during critical periods. Even in a cost-regulated pool in which the highest energy transfer price is the energy cost of a CT, the true value of capacity over (say) a year can be either greater or less than the annual carrying cost of a CT if the system is not fully optimal for the specific demand pattern of that year – which will virtually always be the case.  In particular, the value of pure capacity can be essentially zero if there is enough excess capacity and/or if new technology with much lower costs is in the process of displacing older, less efficient capacity.  Even if the annual value of capacity over some year is, by coincidence, equal to the annual carrying cost of a CT, the true monthly, weekly and hourly values of capacity will vary widely over the year and hence cannot be determined simply by spreading the annual capacity value equally over all periods of the year. In regulated, cost-based pools, it is common practice to require a member with a capacity deficiency to pay a monthly capacity deficiency penalty (CDP) equal to that member’s highest hourly deficiency during the month multiplied by the monthly (or one-twelfth of the annual) carrying cost of a CT, even if the deficiency occurs only once during the month and during an hour in which the true value of capacity is small or zero.  This may be acceptable given that the real purpose of a CDP in a cost-based pool is not to serve as a proxy for the value of capacity but to bludgeon each regulated monopoly member of the pool into buying its own capacity even if it is very costly to do so.  But nobody should make the mistake of assuming that such a calculation has anything to do with estimating the actual value of capacity over the month even in a cost-based pool, much less in a competitive energy market.  “CAPACITY” IS NOT A LOGICAL CONCEPT IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET In a competitive electricity market, the old regulatory concepts underlying capacity payments and obligations no longer apply.  Settlement prices in a pool-based market are not set by the observable variable energy costs of some specific machine, but by the interaction of supply and demand in each pricing/settlement hour.  These fundamentally different pricing arrangements invalidate the basic concept that capacity is a commodity separate from E&AS, and particularly the notion that capacity deserves to be paid for simply existing as opposed to providing and being paid for actual E&AS.   “Capacity” Has No Value Unless E&AS Are Underpriced  Figure 2: E&AS Pricing in a Well - Functioning Market Efficient E&AS Prices Time $/MWh Actual E&AS Market Prices Under Pricing Over Pricing    If the hourly markets for E&AS always clear, in the sense that hourly prices always go as high as necessary to call forth enough supply to meet demand at that price, there is clearly no need or justification for any additional capacity payment.  There is no justification for defining and making periodic payments for pure capacity or ICAP as a product distinct from any real E&AS unless hourly E&AS prices do not rise enough during periods of scarcity to clear the market and hence generating capacity does not earn what it “should” from E&AS prices alone.  And if E&AS pricing is deficient in this sense, the obvious solution is to improve E&AS pricing, not to paper it over with a general payment made to all capacity whether or not it helps solve the problems created by the mispricing of E&AS. The pricing concepts that apply in a competitive market are illustrated in Figure 2.  When E&AS prices are based on supply and demand as defined by generator offers and demand bids or forecasts, they will often be imperfect compared to the efficient prices that would prevail if competition and the pricing rules were perfect, simply because nothing is perfect in the real world.  But the market prices will be a reasonable approximation to the true competitive prices, because if they are not the markets will not clear and the excess supply or demand will soon become obvious.  In any case, the fact that actual market prices are always imperfect in an imperfect world provides no basis for a general presumption that market prices are too low on average compared to efficient, competitive prices. Actual market prices may be too low during critical periods if there are price caps or technical limits on high prices, or they may be too high if market power is particularly strong during such periods.  Actual market prices may be too low during off-peak periods if some generators are operating to meet contract loads when it would be more efficient for them to shut down and buy from other generators, or they may be too high if the market rules do not properly deal with inflexible generators.  Actual market prices may be too high during high-but-not-quite-peak demand periods if market power can be exercised then without violating price caps or attracting too much political heat.  Where technical mispricing or the exercise of market power is identified, it should be fixed when and if it is practical and cost-effective to do so.  Mispricing of E&AS should not be tolerated and then used as an excuse for separate capacity payments – particularly when there is no basis for a general presumption that E&AS prices are too low on average. As illustrated in Figure 2, if generating capacity deserves any extra periodic payment the amount it deserves over a period such as a month is the NET sum over the month of all the hourly differences between efficient E&AS prices and actual market prices.  This principle implies several important conclusions about any periodic payment that is intended to compensate for market mispricing of E&AS, including the following:  The level of capacity payments needed to compensate for mispricing of E&AS has nothing to do with the carrying costs of a CT unless some very restrictive conditions apply, including:  The market price of energy is limited to the variable energy costs of a CT; There is no excess capacity; There are no separate payments for reserves and ancillary services; and A CT is the lowest-fixed-cost way to assure that supply equals demand in critical periods.    In a market in which energy prices can and do increase to very high levels when the demand/supply balance is tight, and in which there are separate payments for reserves and other ancillary services, the value of capacity may be small, zero or – if market power or other factors push average E&AS prices above efficient, competitive market levels – even negative.     Even price caps in the E&AS markets do not necessarily imply that capacity needs or deserves a separate payment, provided that any such price cap has the intent and effect of preventing flawed pricing rules or generator market power from driving prices above “true” market-clearing levels at critical times.     Estimating the value of capacity administratively as the gap between the annual carrying cost of “pure capacity” and what such capacity earns in the E&AS market is impractical, because it requires making judgments/guesses about both:  (1) what type of machine – e.g., a CT, an old steam turbine or a CC – or activity – e.g., load management or imports –is the cheapest source of “pure capacity;” and (2) how much that machine/activity will need in addition to E&AS payments to cover its full costs.     If E&AS are underpriced and hence capacity has some value, this value can in principle be estimated using a market process in which generators compete to provide the capacity needed, either to LSEs or (probably better) directly to the RTO.  Experience in NEPOOL and elsewhere demonstrates, however, that such a capacity market requires many difficult judgments by the RTO and regulators and is subject to extreme forms of gaming.     Even a market-determined capacity payment is an inefficient way to solve any problems caused by flawed E&AS pricing, because periodic capacity payments do little to assure that the capacity receiving the payment is actually available when needed or to stimulate demand-side responses at the right times and places.  It is far better to improve spot E&AS markets to assure that enough capacity is actually available and that loads get the right price signals to reduce demands at critical times.   E&AS Are Not Generally Underpriced in Pool-Based Markets Energy prices in a well-designed electricity market may, during normal periods when there is plenty of generating capacity relative to demand, reflect the observable energy costs of the units that are on the margin at that time.  But during critical supply/demand periods, the energy price may – and should – go to very high scarcity levels that are many times the observable incremental energy costs of any physical unit.  Depending on the market rules, the high energy prices during such periods may be set by demand-side bids, by supply offers from energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units with low observable energy costs but high opportunity costs, by the high costs of emergency purchases, imports or recalled export transactions, or by administrative rules that set prices based on an estimated loss-of-load probability (LoLP) and deemed value-of-lost-load (VoLL). Furthermore, every pool-based electricity market pays generators not only for energy actually produced, but also for operating reserves and other ancillary services, at prices that reflect the opportunity costs of not-producing energy and hence increase to very high levels when energy prices do.  This is in marked contrast with traditional capacity-sharing pools, in which capacity is usually required to provide ancillary services essentially for free; indeed, the fact that units provide such services when they are not producing energy is an important justification for capacity obligations and payments in such systems.   In a well-designed pool-based market, generating units (and even controllable loads) can make substantial money providing reserves and ancillary services even if they do not produce energy – provided that they have the physical characteristics that make them useful for these purposes. Whatever the details of the pricing mechanism in a pool-based market, such a market is a very different animal from the cost-based utility pools that require capacity payments and/or obligations.  If spot E&AS prices are doing what they should be doing, they are inducing generators to provide E&AS when and where these are actually needed and compensating them adequately for doing so.  These spot E&AS prices are also producing hourly prices to at least some, mostly large consumers that will stimulate demand-side responses that will help clear the market at lower prices and reduce supply-side market power.  There is no reason to assume that the E&AS prices in a competitive market will be too low at critical times or on average to cover the full costs of capacity or to stimulate the addition of new capacity by profit-seeking investors. In summary, generators in a market-drive electricity system earn far more from the sale of E&AS than they would earn selling energy at cost-based prices limited by the observed energy cost of a CT, as would be the case in a cost-based pool.  The fact that cost-regulated pools make capacity payments based on the carrying costs of a CT provides absolutely no justification for assuming that generating units in a market-based electricity system need or deserve anything more than they get from energy prices, much less for assuming that they need or deserve a capacity payment that has anything to do with the carrying cost of a CT.  INSTALLED  CAPACITY  OBLIGATIONS Requiring load-serving entities to provide capacity is at best an inefficient tax/subsidy arrangement and at worst is inconsistent with efficient and nondiscriminatory competition. This section discusses the leading contender for a method of providing capacity payments to generators over and above payments for the E&AS they actually provide, which is some form of the installed capacity (ICAP) requirement imposed on LSEs by the ISOs in PJM, New England and New York; it is no coincidence that all of these markets developed from tight power pools in which ICAP requirements were essential.  Actual and proposed ICAP systems differ in details, but all require LSEs to own or contract for enough ICAP to meet their projected or actual loads over some period with some reserve margin, with the ISO defining how much ICAP each LSE must buy and how much each generating unit can sell, the penalties (if any) for failure of ICAP to perform, and the penalties on LSEs for failure to contract for enough ICAP.  Such systems result in periodic – e.g., seasonal, monthly or daily – payments from LSEs to generators over and above any hourly payments for E&AS actually provided.  ICAP IS NOT A REAL PRODUCT THAT PROVIDES REAL SERVICES  In order to qualify to sell ICAP, a generating unit typically needs do nothing except demonstrate that it passed an availability test at some earlier time.  A generator selling ICAP may take on an obligation to offer E&AS into the RTO’s spot market when it is “available,” but can set its offer prices as high as it pleases (up to any price caps in the market).  The ICAP seller has no obligation to deliver E&AS at a specified price or at all, to buy replacement E&AS if it cannot deliver, or even to be available to deliver anything during critical hours or even during projected peak hours.  Indeed, a unit can be paid for ICAP even if it is out of service and hence can do absolutely nothing for the LSE that is paying for ICAP or for the system as a whole. The LSE who pays for ICAP gets no energy at a defined price, no compensation if the generator selling the ICAP is not available and no special reliability benefits.  All LSEs (or their customers who are final consumers) may get some benefits in the form of less volatile prices, but this is a generalized benefit that comes at the expense of higher average prices. Thus, whatever else may be said about ICAP, it is not a normal commodity.  Even if it is worthwhile paying ICAP just for existing, as opposed to providing real E&AS, trying to treat ICAP as a normal commodity by requiring or even allowing LSEs to buy it from generators bilaterally is a complex and inefficient way to accomplish what can be accomplished more easily in other ways.  AN ICAP OBLIGATION IS AN INEFFICIENT TAX/SUBSIDY ARRANGEMENT If an ICAP obligation does anything except transfer money from LSEs/consumers to generators for doing nothing, it subsidizes the existence of generating capacity generally, without regard to what any specific generating unit can or does do to provide services valued by LSEs or the RTO.  Presumably having more capacity around has some benefits, such as reducing wholesale E&AS prices on average and particularly during critical periods when E&AS prices would otherwise be very high and volatile.  But the lower average wholesale E&AS prices will be more than offset at the retail level by the ICAP payments that LSEs must make and then recover from their customers, and the lower E&AS prices during critical periods will make it harder to match supply to demand during such periods.  The net effect is that the average prices paid by consumers are higher, if somewhat less volatile. An arrangement under which a buyer faces less risk of occasional very high payments but makes more predictable periodic payments that are higher on average is a form of insurance.  Any insurance arrangement increases “moral hazard” and hence costs, but the higher costs can be worth paying if the risk reduction is large enough and cannot be obtained some other, lower-cost way.  The basic problem with an ICAP obligation is that it forces all consumers to pay for one specific, and highly inefficient and ineffectual form of price insurance whether they want it or not, when there is no reason to socialize costs in this way and many good reasons not to do so. An ICAP obligation is a very inefficient form of price insurance.  It is analogous to a law requiring all automobile owners to pay monthly premiums to an accident insurance scheme that subsidizes the existence of body shops but does not pay for specific repairs.  The subsidies to body shops might reduce the market price of repairs, so car owners might get something for their money.  But there are much more efficient ways to organize the automobile insurance business. An ICAP obligation is not only a highly inefficient form of price insurance, but it is a mandatory one that does not let LSEs or their customers use their premium money to buy different and better forms of insurance for themselves.  Such forced socialization of risks is seldom efficient, should be avoided if possible and is certainly not required to make electricity markets work.  In the absence of the ICAP obligation, the price of energy in spot markets would tend to be more volatile, but any individual LSE or consumer could contract with any competitive retailer for the form of price insurance that best meets its needs.  Generators would still be able to get periodic capacity payments instead of purely spot E&AS payments if that is what they wanted, but to do so they would have to sell contracts to buyers who would want something in return. It is understandable that generators usually prefer ICAP obligations on LSEs to a real commercial contract market; automobile body shop owners would also probably prefer to be subsidized for existing rather than being paid only when they actually repaired something.  But there is no reason for the Commission to grant generators such a self-serving wish. Many consumers would probably prefer the socialized form of insurance implied by an ICAP obligation on LSEs to being exposed to volatile spot prices.  But final consumers who want price insurance can and should get it through the retail market, and even final consumers who want regulated price insurance can and should get it from the state regulators responsible for retail competition under the federal system in the United States. One of the principal purposes of competition is to reduce the extent to which risks are socialized.  The Commission should assure that the wholesale market provides reliable supply at efficient wholesale prices so that final consumers allowed to shop for supplies can decide for themselves how much price insurance to buy and so that state legislators and regulators can decide how much socialized price insurance they want for consumers in their states.  An ICAP obligation at the Commission-regulated RTO level would limit the choices available to the states and final consumers.  CAPACITY OBLIGATIONS DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY Hourly E&AS prices that vary widely in response to system conditions may be politically and commercially unwelcome, but actually enhance system reliability by providing price signals that encourage helpful demand and supply responses.  In a well-functioning market E&AS prices will increase at the right times (and, with locational marginal pricing or LMP, at the right places) to assure that E&AS are available and that demand is reduced when (and where) needed for reliability purposes in the short run.  In the longer run, market-clearing E&AS prices will stimulate the right combination of shutdown/restart decisions for existing capacity, the right mix of investment in new generation and the right demand-side investment decisions.  Nothing more is needed or desirable, and nothing nearly this efficient will be stimulated by an ICAP obligation that pays generators just for existing. An ICAP obligation does little to make it easier for a RTO to maintain reliability.  The generators receiving ICAP payments have little or no obligation to do anything in return except perhaps make themselves available in the spot markets at a price of their own choosing, so the RTO must still design and operate markets to assure that adequate E&AS are available when and where needed.  A high enough ICAP obligation enforced by a high enough deficiency penalty will certainly keep some old plants in service longer than they otherwise would be and might increase investment in new plants temporarily.  But the additional excess capacity will tend to reduce wholesale E&AS prices, particularly during critical periods, making it harder for the ISO to balance supply and demand during such periods, while increasing the average retail prices that include the ICAP payments in addition to wholesale E&AS prices. Virtually by definition, if periodic ICAP payments have any effect they must subsidize the existence of plants that would otherwise not be there because they are not very good at responding to the occasional high E&AS prices eliminated by the ICAP payments.  In effect, the ICAP payments subsidize continued operation of older, less efficient capacity, and investment in new but inflexible capacity, at the expense of newer, more flexible capacity that is more useful for reliability purposes.  The RTO must and will use its short-term E&AS markets to maintain reliability either way.  An ICAP obligation enforced by a significant deficiency penalty will just increase total costs to consumers.  CAPACITY IS (OR SHOULD NOT BE) A PUBLIC GOOD OR ANCILLARY SERVICE The reliability of an electricity system is, at some level, a “public good,” the cost of which must be socialized through a tax on consumers similar to the tax inherent in an ICAP requirement; for example, the inability to price reactive power and minute-to-minute variations in supply and demand requires the ISO to procure ancillary services to manage these effects and to socialize the costs across consumers through a tax or “uplift.”  But the fact that some services must be treated this way is not justification for treating all services this way. Instead of starting with the premise that something called “reliability” is a public good the cost of which must be socialized, it is better to start with the premise that reliability requires many different services, many of which cannot be priced accurately with traditional, decentralized market devices.  The difference between these two starting premises is critical, and is not just a matter of semantics:  the basic question raised by public goods is how to tax consumers to pay for them, while the basic question raised by market failures is how to improve markets to reduce them. The challenge for wholesale market design is to design innovative market arrangements that can fix market failures so that as more individual services can be priced more accurately, thereby reducing the costs that must be socialized through RTO-provided ancillary services.  ICAP payments or obligations essentially treat the provision of “capacity” as an ancillary service that must be managed by the RTO and paid for through a socialized uplift.  But there is no fundamental reason that the wholesale market cannot price E&AS at market-clearing levels every hour (or even every minute) at every location on the grid, even if some averaging of these prices is necessary at the retail level.  If the Commission pushes RTOs to price E&AS as accurately as possible, the use of ancillary services – including ICAP payments or obligations – to socialize costs can be minimized and the freedom of choice of final consumers (and state regulators) can be maximized. If it is decided to treat capacity as a public good or ancillary service by imposing capacity payments or ICAP obligations, it would probably be wise to take this decision to its logical conclusion and let the RTO acquire ICAP as an ancillary service and socialize the costs across consumers as a whole.  The fiction that ICAP is a private good that individual LSEs buy from individual generators creates complexity and opportunities for gaming the RTO’s rules.  CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  E&AS SPOT PRICING CAN AND SHOULD ASSURE RELIABILITY The best way to assure reliability in a competitive electricity market is to assure that RTOs operate efficient spot markets in E&AS that reflect the real-time actions and effects that ultimately determine reliability.  If this is done, the physical markets will always clear and all suppliers of capacity and all loads that manage their demand will be adequately compensated through the market-clearing prices they are paid or pay for E&AS.  There will be no need to require the RTO to define how much of what kind of “capacity” should be paid how much simply for existing as opposed to providing useful E&AS, and how the resulting costs should be socialized across consumers.  Conversely, to the extent that E&AS spot markets are not designed or allowed to clear, the RTO will have to use ancillary services and cost socialization to maintain reliability, with less help from demand-side responses; if the RTO’s role increases very far in this direction, competition will be inefficient, distorted and ineffective.  PROVIDING PRICE STABILITY IS THE FUNCTION OF CONTRACTS The function of electricity spot markets is to provide and price the services required for reliable and efficient operations of an electricity system.  The function of contracts is to protect generators, middlemen and final consumers from the risks of spot market prices to the extent they mutually want price stability.  These functions should not be confused by such devices as capacity payments or ICAP obligations that, in effect, use wholesale market rules to impose an inefficient and mandatory form of price insurance on everybody.  If the wholesale spot markets price as many E&AS as practical as accurately as practical, generators and competitive final consumers can decide for themselves how much price insurance they want to buy for themselves, and the state regulators responsible for retail markets can decide whether and how they want to provide socialized price insurance for some or all consumers in their individual states.  The Commission should seek to maximize the freedom of choice at this level.  ANY CAPACITY PAYMENTS/OBLIGATIONS SHOULD BE TRANSITIONAL The Commission may decide that RTO spot markets in E&AS are so inefficient or – perhaps more importantly – so little understood or trusted by the public that they cannot be relied upon to provide reliability at this time, and hence RTOs should impose some sort of capacity payment or ICAP obligation in the short run.  In this case, the Commission should make it clear that the ultimate objective is efficient wholesale E&AS markets that can clear without separate capacity payments or obligations, that RTOs should continue development of such markets on an expedited basis, and that any separate capacity payments or obligations are transitional devices that must end at some defined time in the near future.    For simplicity, the discussion here assumes that the pricing/settlement period is an hour, even though shorter periods are better and are used in most pool-based markets.   The conceptual discussion here is in terms of a hypothetical compound commodity called “E&AS,” in order to emphasize that if capacity has any value it is because total generator revenue from ALL services provided, not just energy, is too low.   Although each E&AS is priced separately in the wholesale spot market, consumers see a single rolled-in energy price.  But hourly energy prices to hourly-metered consumers will presumably reflect all the hourly E&AS prices and hence give consumers the right incentives to reduce demand at critical times.   Moral hazard is a term of art used in the actuarial world to describe the effect that insurance inevitably has on incentives.  Any rational person, not just an immoral one, will take less care to avoid accidents or other undesirable outcomes if the resulting costs will be shared with others.  begin:vcard  n:Hahn;Tom tel;work:(919) 969-9779 x-mozilla-html:FALSE url:www.apbenergy.com org:APB Energy/Chapel Hill Division version:2.1 email;internet:tom.hahn@apbenergy.com title:Executive Vice President adr;quoted-printable:;;6320 Quadrangle Drive=0D=0ASuite 380;Chapel Hill;NC;27514; note;quoted-printable:Tom Hahn=0D=0AExecutive Vice President=0D=0AAPB Energy, Inc.=0D=0A6320 Quadrangle Dr. Suite 380=0D=0AChapel Hill, NC  27514=0D=0A(919) 969-9779=0D=0Awww.apbenergy.com x-mozilla-cpt:;32416 fn:Tom Hahn end:vcard

Date: Wed, 16 May 2001 11:32:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Jeff King To: Joe Quenet Subject: Load Forecasting Technology X-SDOC: 940812 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-389.eml  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff King/Corp/Enron on 05/16/2001 09:32  AM ---------------------------   Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM To: robert.benson@enron.com, jeff.king@enron.com, kyle.schultz@enron.com,  doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,  paul.j.broderick@enron.com, tom.may@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com cc:    Subject: Load Forecasting Technology   To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

Hokit, President, stated that ``many household name companies have requested that we begin to service their accounts in our current market. Consequently, we continue our planned multiphase expansion to serve the Military Resale Market. Military Resale Group, Inc. is negotiating with several companies to obtain new business and anticipates showing continued growth in sales, which the new warehouse would accommodate.''  In 1999, Military Resale Group, Inc. was housed in a 2,500- square-foot warehouse and a few months later acquired another 2,000 square feet. In October 1999, the Company acquired another 7,500 square feet, bringing its total to 12,000 square feet. This space was adequate until a few months ago, when it became evident that more warehouse space was needed to support the growth that the Company is experiencing.  Military Resale Group, Inc. (MRG) was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military Resale Market. At that time MRG's annual sales were $750,000, and they have since soared five-fold in three years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now a publicly owned company as a result of its recent acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).  The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market, with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The competitive structure of the Military Resale Market consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post- acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by internal growth.

Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king. - (1 Samuel 15:23)   A friend of mine who is a jet pilot once told me that whenever a jet goes out of control and begins to spin, the only thing to do is totally take your hands off the controls and the plane will right itself. This goes against our natural inclination to control and manipulate in order to bring things back under control. It is scary to be out of control. Or is it?  Saul was a man out of control. He was losing control of his kingdom to David. He was losing the favor of God and the people. It began as compromises. Eventually he was given a final test to obey the voice of God fully. He was instructed to kill the Amalekites completely; but he failed to follow through. The prophet Samuel delivered a hard word to King Saul, "Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king" (see 1 Sam. 15:26). Saul obeyed partially, but not fully. It was partial obedience that led to his removal as king of Israel and his calling from God. But why did Saul do such a thing? "I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them" (1 Sam. 15:24b). Saul's fear and insecurity made him more afraid of the people and what they thought than of God. At the core of Saul's disobedience was fear of losing control. That fear of losing control led to partial obedience and the loss of his reign as king.  How many of us are in danger of losing God's blessing due to partial obedience? How many of us have such a need to control people and circumstances that we fail to fully walk in obedience to God's voice in our lives? Saul provides a great lesson for us as businesspeople. The need to overcontrol things around us can prevent us from receiving all that God has for us. Today, take an inventory of your control quotient.  Ask God if you are being fully obedient to what He has called you to do this day, and avoid being put on the shelf for disobedience. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. 15:22b).

Date: Wed, 16 May 2001 11:30:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Jeff King To: Mike Carson, Chris Dorland Subject: Load Forecasting Technology X-SDOC: 940811 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-388.eml  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff King/Corp/Enron on 05/16/2001 09:30  AM ---------------------------   Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM To: robert.benson@enron.com, jeff.king@enron.com, kyle.schultz@enron.com,  doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,  paul.j.broderick@enron.com, tom.may@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com cc:    Subject: Load Forecasting Technology   To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

Paul mentions three more pieces of armor that we must take up to protect ourselves from Satan's attack: the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit which is the Word of God. The first three (the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of peace) are established by our position in Christ; these last three help us continue to win the battle.  Contrary to popular perception, there is nothing mystical about faith. Biblical faith is simply what you believe about God and His Word. The more you know about God and His Word, the more faith you will have. The less you know, the smaller your shield will be and the easier it will be for one of Satan's fiery darts to reach its target. If you want your shield of faith to grow large and protective, your knowledge of God and His Word must increase (Romans 10:17).  These flaming missiles from Satan are nothing more than smoldering lies, burning accusations, and fiery temptations bombarding our minds. When a deceptive thought, accusation, or temptation enters your mind, meet it head-on with what you know to be true about God and His Word. How did Jesus deflect the missiles of Satan's temptation? By shielding Himself with statements from the Word of God. Every time you memorize a Bible verse, listen to a sermon, or participate in a Bible study, you increase your knowledge of God and enlarge your shield of faith.  We all struggle with tempting and accusing thoughts. If you are a healthy and mature Christian, they will bounce right off your shield of faith.  Lord, I raise up the shield of faith today and stand against tempting and accusing thoughts from the evil one.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.

This is a universal truth. Wisdom comes from obedience, not knowledge. When we have been tested and proven, the reality of our faith results in possessions from God that we would never receive if we had not gone through those trials. These are precious in His sight and should be valued greatly. Those who know you will be amazed at the wisdom that comes from your mouth. It is one of those mysteries of the gospel that only those who experience incredible testing and hardship can explain.  God kept the people of Israel enslaved 400 years, but when the time came to free them from the bondage of slavery, they came out with great possessions. These physical possessions symbolize the spiritual possessions we receive when we come out of being enslaved to those things that have hindered us all our lives. These possessions are to be shared with others so that they also can know how they might become free.  What has God freed you from that allows you to share your possessions with others? Share what God has done in your life with someone you work with today. It may be the possession they need most in their life.

B. Meyer in his book, The Life of Joseph, describes a time in the life of the 12 sons of Jacob in which they were driven from their lives of self-satisfaction to an unlikely place to save their lives. Many years earlier they had thrown their youngest brother into a pit, then sold him into slavery. Thirteen years later he became the second most powerful person in Egypt. Now the world was experiencing a famine, and Joseph controlled all the stored grain of Egypt.  As long as the hills were green and the pastures clothed with flocks, as long as the valleys were covered over with corn and rang with the songs of reapers, Reuben, Simeon, and the rest of them would have been unconcerned and content. But when the mighty famine came, the hearts of these men were opened to conviction. Their carnal security was shattered. They were being prepared for certain spiritual experiences they would never have dreamed. And they were being prepared for the meeting with Joseph. This is how God deals with us; He breaks up our nest, He loosens our roots, He sends a mighty famine that cuts away the whole staff of bread. Then, at such times, weary, worn, and sad, we are prepared to confess our sins and receive the words of Christ when He says, "Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (Mt. 11:28).  A missionary once said, "There is a place where we will all be obedient." Joseph was a type of Christ in the Old Testament. The famine was an event designed to bring the brothers to repentance and a saving knowledge, physically and spiritually. It created the circumstances that led to freedom for these men. For they had been in bondage to a wicked crime against their brother for many years. It was the forgiveness from Joseph that led to that freedom.  Is your life passing through a time of famine? Are your supplies limited? Is God leading you into directions that you would not normally seek? Perhaps this is God's hand creating circumstances for His purposes. Now is the time to look attentively as He directs you to unlikely sources.     Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

In the original creation, Adam didn't search for significance; he was significant. He was given rule over all His creatures. Was Satan on the scene at creation? Yes. Was he the god of this world at that time? Not at all. Who had the dominion in the garden? Under the authority of God, Adam did, that is until Satan usurped his dominion when Adam and Eve fell. That's when Satan became the god of this world.  Do you realize that the significant dominion Adam exercised before the Fall has been restored to you as a Christian? That's part of your inheritance in Christ. Satan has no authority over you, even though he will try to deceive you into believing that he has. Because of your position in Christ, you have authority over him. You are seated with Christ in the heavenlies (Ephesians 2:6).  First John 3:8 says, "The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil." The whole plan of God is to restore fallen humanity and establish the kingdom of God where Satan now reigns. This work of God is not just for our personal victory but for all of creation. "For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God" (Romans 8:19-21).  Thank You, Lord, that I am part of Your redemptive plan. Show me my responsibility so I may live a life of purpose.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.  Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.  Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.   Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.   Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.  If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60 cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1 reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 - $6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The whole transaction took less than a year.   TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP  PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.  The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites certain caveats including that ``...these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by TSYI....''  The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In conclusion, the process and its potential application to utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''  Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization, including those mentioned in this report. But, we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''  Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is presently a development-stage company. It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state, using air as the medium of movement. This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials. Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry-process technology. This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures, including: drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction, Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation, agriculture, mining, environment, construction, ceramics, and materials transportation. We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years, if adopted for implementation in several large projects. Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18 million shares currently outstanding.

X-SDOC: 940818 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-395.eml  Current Notes User:  REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.  2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.  PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.  HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user  id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You  will now be able to view your mailbox.     PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between  the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things  in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the  functions NOT available via OWA:  Features NOT available using OWA:  -  Tasks -  Journal -  Spell Checker -  Offline Use -  Printing Templates -  Reminders -  Timed Delivery -  Expiration -  Outlook Rules -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall -  Sharing Contacts with others -  Task Delegation -  Direct Resource Booking -  Personal Distribution Lists  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?  If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the  Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:   Outlook.2000@enron.com  Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:   713-853-1411  Thank you,  Outlook 2000 Migration Team  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc. (collectively, “Enron”) submit these comments. BACKGROUND Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (“EPMI”) is an affiliate of Enron North America Corp. (“ENA”) and was formed to develop a North American merchant services business in electric power.  Drawing on ENA's experience in the development of a commodity market for natural gas, EPMI has developed a range of products and services related to the purchase, sale and delivery of electric power and the management of associated price risks.  EPMI markets these products throughout the United States.  EPMI functions as a power marketer pursuant to a Commission order issued December 2, 1993.  Enron Power Marketing, Inc., 65 FERC ¶ 61,305, order on reh’g, 66 FERC ¶ 61,244 (1994).   Enron Energy Services, Inc. (“EES”) is a leading provider of natural gas and electric power to the commercial and retail markets in the United States.  In addition to making retail sales of natural gas and electricity, EES offers a broad range of energy products, capital, technology and related service capabilities, such as demand side management designed to decrease energy costs, consolidated billing, and related energy asset management.  EES is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron Corp., one of the world’s largest publicly-held integrated energy companies.  EPMI and EES are referred to collectively as “Enron”. Additionally, attached is an affidavit of Larry E. Ruff, PhD. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Enron opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requirements.  Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations (“RTOs”) that encompass robust, competitive spot markets for energy and operating reserve products (including demand side management products) will provide an efficient and timely solution to incent construction of adequate generation, the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand side management products to ensure that demand is met in real time.  Spot markets reveal the cost of procuring  (or not using) electricity based on actual supply and demand conditions and, thus, signal the need for new generation capacity.  They also ensure that consumers ‘see’ the cost of procurement decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based on discovered prices.  These markets will keep supply and demand in balance in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning criteria.  Therefore, there is no need to continue separate installed capacity requirements in an RTO environment. The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is new to the electricity industry.  Regulated consumers have historically paid utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions.  These regulated tariffs provide little, if any, meaningful supply/demand price information to the consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the underlying “cost” of doing so has been high.  As a result, demand curves have been categorized as ‘inelastic’ or ‘vertical’ suggesting the need for ‘capacity’ related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand.  The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will, for the first time, give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information.  Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need for specific capacity related payments as supply/demand interaction, and curtailment, will be based on economic choices. COMMENTS  I.  Importance of RTOs  The most important fact to consider in evaluating alternatives to current capacity constructs is the Commission’s decision to establish four RTOs nationwide (outside of ERCOT).  Enron fully agrees with this decision.  Establishment of appropriately sized RTOs with real time spot markets will provide the incentives to build generation in a timely manner (as well as provide the basis for alternative solutions, such as transmission siting and demand side management).  A well functioning RTO will provide many benefits to the electricity grid of the United States:  increased reliability through increased coordination and improved real-time pricing; flexibility and diversity of supply; better ability to identify and price true transmission constraints (rather than artificial, institutionally created constraints); greater capability to minimize energy costs through incorporation and pricing of real constraints in dispatch; more ability to provide better price signals that encourage demand side management; and greater incentive to invest in transmission where warranted.  These benefits will bring confidence in the market to attract more participants and market activity and to ensure that capacity adequacy is achieved. An appropriately sized RTO that is centrally coordinated and operates (or at least assures the existence of) efficient spot markets in energy, ancillary services and transmission capacity can improve the security, reliability and economic benefits of the grid by providing an independent coordination process between operators and generators, and by facilitating market liquidity through hub trading and real time information.  This central coordination and efficient pricing advances security and reliability through the ability of the RTO to make decisions based on regional data, rather than the current decentralized decision-making.  Reserves can be managed and priced on an RTO-wide basis, rather than by control area, providing the RTO a greater ability to reliably and efficiently transmit electricity from location to location, while increasing reserve sharing and reducing total reserve requirements.  Moreover, the grid itself will be improved as capital is invested based on increased knowledge of locational and operational requirements, real time market supply and demand information, and prices that the RTO will provide.  Moreover, the RTO will be able to provide greater system security and reliability through this coordination process due to the ability to react more quickly utilizing a much wider supply as well as to take advantage of demand diversity.  All of these positive results of an RTO will facilitate investment in generation capacity. Accurate real time nodal prices that result from the interaction of all market participants will provide the essential price signals to best determine the location and necessity of new investment in generation, transmission, and demand side management.  For the first time, consumers will ‘see’ the price effects of consumption and be able to change the shape of or curtail demand in response.  This demand elasticity, which is seen in every competitive sector of the United States economy, is new to the electricity market and will eliminate the need for incentive based capacity payments, such as ‘icap’.  Individual demand participants, acting directly or through a retail load aggregator, will be able to choose whether to consume during times of high prices or not and receive the resulting economic benefits. In summary, the stated purpose of capacity products, such as “resources”, “icap”, “reserves” or any of the other names/procedures used across the country, will by achieved by the implementation of RTOs and efficient spot markets in energy, ancillary services and transmission capacity. Therefore, Enron urges and supports the Commission in its effort to continue the implementation of the RTOs and to achieve the goal of well functioning markets in the entire United  States. II.  Spot Markets and Capacity Payments. Capacity payments are a supplemental fee paid to generators to purportedly ensure they provide a sufficient level of generation “capacity”, or generation “reserves”, for reliable operation of the power system in real time.  They come in different forms ranging from icap, which is an explicit payment for capacity, to a reserve margin requirement: all implicitly increase the cost of wholesale electricity.  However, properly functioning icap markets are difficult to design as they are subject to manipulation and market power (e.g. economic withholding of icap from the bilateral market as suggested by FERC in “Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves in Today’s Energy Markets”, Study Team Discussion Paper). Historically, capacity payments and reserve requirements have been treated exclusively from a supply side perspective.  This is not unexpected, as the wholesale electricity market has been tightly regulated.  Consumers have not made pricing decisions:  regulators have been responsible for making these decisions for them.  As a result, negotiations between regulators and incumbent utilities focused on ensuring that the power system has enough generation capacity to meet peak demand, with adequate reserves to guarantee a minimum level of reliability if parts of the electric system fail.  The capacity adequacy planning process and the mechanism to incentivize and remunerate those reserves was entirely focused on supply side solutions.  Other than under emergency situations, demand side solutions were not perceived as a “viable” alternative.  In this environment, reserves were considered a “public” good and property rights for “reserves” were ill defined.  Procurement of capacity reserves in this context can be thought of as a tax on consumers to ensure adequate inventory of “MW capacity” to meet real time demand.  As a consequence, reserves could not be priced by the market and decisions about capacity adequacy and price had to be managed centrally.  During curtailment, all loads would suffer the physical consequences of outages, irrespective of their contracting level. Therefore, there seemed to be no incentives for any individual market participants to manage their need for reserves (or consider their appetite for demand side management).  This resulted in the classical “ free-ride” problem. This mindset was based on a perception of minimal demand elasticity, as shown in the following graph (Figure 1).  Reserve/Capacity Payment Traditional Approach MWh $    MWh D 2 D 3 D 1 P 1 P 2 Reserves D 3 = Curtailment MWh $    MWh D 2 D 3 D 1 P 1 P 2 Reserves D 3 = Curtailment      Figure 1   \      During off-peak periods (Demand D1), substantial competitive resources are available and the market clears at spot price levels (P1).  However, as demand starts growing (from D1 to D2) spot market prices increase.  If demand continues to grow, the spot price is determined by the last segments of a steep supply curve.  If demand grows beyond the ability of the market to supply, load will be curtailed as represented by demand curve D3.  Historically in some instances, spot clearing prices reached a level that triggered a political response in the form of price caps.  The expedient approach for both regulators and suppliers to guarantee that lights stayed on was to introduce explicit capacity adequacy payments and/or cost recovery mechanisms through rates where reserve margins were required. III.  The Need for Demand Side Management As noted above, historical capacity and reserve approaches have been based on the assumption that the demand curve is inelastic or near vertical.  This assumption is incorrect.  This is not a radical discovery, it simply reflects basic economic theory and the evidence that abounds in the wider deregulated United States economy:  consumption behavior responds to price signals.  However, in the electric sector, customers have systematically been shielded from “seeing” and therefore “acting upon” price, which confirmed, at least on the surface, the assumption of limited demand elasticity. Simply put, the issue of reserves and capacity payments has to be viewed from both a supply and demand perspective.  As a result, Enron encourages the Commission to take a fresh look at the reserve/capacity problem, and utilize the solution that RTO structures offer -- spot markets. A.  The Introduction of Demand Elasticity through DSM The need for capacity adequacy payments, separate from spot market payments, is eliminated as demand elasticity is introduced. This is illustrated in Figure 2.  In simple, practical words, consumers reduce consumption (or interrupt their loads) as prices go above a certain level (different consumers make different choices about price levels).  This summer, New York’s demand side management programs provided 600 MWs of peak reduction.  Empirical evidence in other deregulated wholesale electricity markets show that this is a workable and feasible proposition.  The same evidence has shown that with proper telemetering and switching systems, load response is virtually instantaneous! When demand becomes elastic, interruptible load becomes a surrogate for reserves.  The market clearing price will reduce not only because demand is less steep, but also because marginal reserve providers will face more competition.  However, this change in the competitive equilibrium is unlikely to ‘hurt’ suppliers of reserves, it simply provides a market signal on the level of reserves necessary to achieve a certain reliability level.  In contrast to Figure 1, Figure 2 shows that as a result of demand response to price, the window or “range” of actions between “reasonable” spot prices and curtailment widens significantly allowing suppliers of reserve and demand side bidders to actively participate (and compete) to provide system reliability.    Reserve/Capacity Payment New Approach MWh $    MWh D 1 P 1 P 2 Reserves Reserves Less Valuable Wide Gap D 3 MWh $    MWh D 1 P 1 P 2 Reserves Reserves Less Valuable Wide Gap D 3             This enables regulators to deal with reserves and reliability as a “market-driven” issue.  Consumers, unwilling to face high spot prices, will likely increase their contracting levels or change the shape of their demand curve by “offering” a significant part of load as interruptible.  Similarly, less reliable generation plants, which experience unexpected outages will also be willing to contract for reserves.  Reliability becomes a “product” with an economic value attached to it.  The case for reserves as a public good, and “free riding”, disappears.  As a corollary, the case for market intervention, either by capping spot prices or “administering reserve solutions” weakens as well. This recognition also brings wholesale electricity markets closer to the competitive economy by making reliability (and by implication, reserves) an economic decision.  Each player will make contracting decisions to avoid undue exposure to the spot price and spot price trends, coupled with liquid forward markets, will provide price signals for new investments in reserve and capacity. IV.  Transition to Robust Spot Markets – Capacity Payments on an Interim Basis  Enron recognizes that the United States is currently transitioning from a tightly regulated structure to such a competitive structure.  While the RTO market structures and price mechanisms mentioned above will incentivize participants to make choices about the necessary level of capacity to be installed and for those participants to invest capital in resources, there is likely to be concern by some that such competitive structures may result in political sensitivities in the short run.  These concerns are at worst transitional issues, and at best can be managed through education now, as other segments of the competitive economy manage such issues without attracting political attention. We also recognize the Commission has in the past been reluctant to eliminate the icap requirement altogether in regions where an icap product already exists.  One of the concerns cited by the Commission is the potential disruption of existing forward contracts.  Another concern cited has been reliability.  While the implementation of RTOs will adequately address the reliability issue, the goal of avoiding undue disruption of forward contracts may support a limited transitional period during RTO formation in which icap requirements are retained, but only in regions where they presently exist and only until a date certain.  Enron submits that an appropriate transition period should be no more than two years.  This will balance the need to allow sufficient time for existing forward arrangements to either clear or be restructured against the enormous inefficiency costs an icap requirement imposes on consumers.  Moreover, to foster demand responsive programs in the interim, Enron recommends that any icap program make the same capacity payments available to verifiable interruptible load.  Such payments can help foster interruptible demand during the period to a full real time market price.  If the Commission seeks to implement or amend existing markets as an interim step, Enron sets out an interim approach in Appendix A that it believes minimizes market distortion. CONCLUSION Enron encourages the Commission to fully consider the economic benefits of this solution.  Robust spot markets that encourage efficient and timely supply/demand responses eliminate the need for separate capacity payments.

Dated at Washington, D.C., this ____________________,2001.   ___________________________ ______________________  Appendix A A - Forms to pay for reserves and to achieve system adequacy As Enron stated above, the spot price alone is the best signal for the market to determine system adequacy and remunerate for required reserves. However, when regulatory intervention is perceived to be needed, there are many ways to achieve the overall goal of long run capacity adequacy and payment for required capacity reserves.  For explanatory purposes, those can be grouped into two basic models:  Model # 1 – Determine a “spot price” for reliability and the market will get adjusted to the embedded system adequacy level Model # 2  - Determine a system adequacy target and the market will provide a price for capacity reserves Model # 1 has been used in the UK and in many other countries for quite a long time.  According to this model, the spot price is comprised of two components:  the first is the short run marginal cost (SRMC) determined from the offers of generators (and any load that bids into the pricing mechanism) and the second component is an explicit payment for capacity, called “capacity fee”.  All imbalances are settled at this two-component spot price.  The capacity fee is an extra spot payment paid by the load and received by all generators that either generate or make themselves available to generate, if necessary.  In concept, the spot capacity payment or “adder” is based on the power system reliability (or lack thereof) as measured by the Loss of Load Probability (or LOLP). LOLP measures the likelihood that the existing generating capacity (including reserves) at any moment in time will not be able to meet peak demand conditions, therefore causing a supply interruption.  The more reserves a power system has, the lower LOLP is going to be.  The payment to reserve capacity, which varies on an hour-by-hour basis, depends on how much customers are willing to pay to avoid interruption.  This is measured by the so called Value of Loss Load (or VLL).  The multiplication of VLL by LOLP, at any give point in time, represents approximately the payment to be made to generators.  VLL is a parameter set “administratively”, and is meant to be a proxy for the average customer’s maximum willingness to pay to avoid curtailment. In practice, the function determining how the level of the spot capacity fee or adder depends on system conditions will be determined pragmatically.  The critical components are that: (i) the spot energy-plus-capacity price increases to some high VLL point if load actually is shed due to generation inadequacy and increases “almost” to this level when load is “almost” shed, i.e., when operating reserves are dangerously low, and (ii) the spot capacity fee or adder be essentially zero during hours when there is plenty of capacity available to provide energy and operating reserves.  If the spot capacity fee meets these criteria, the level of reserves will be adequate and will be determined by the market, based on the market participants’ supply/demand forecasts.  Producers will use resulting forward curves to determine when and where it is appropriate to build new capacity.  In this scenario, no reserve requirement obligations are imposed on load serving entities.   Model # 2 assumes that a certain “quantity” of reserves will be defined.  According to this model, a regulatory entity will define a certain “reserve requirement” which should be consistent with reliability and system adequacy targets.  In the United States, it has been usual to adopt a LOLP of 1 day every 10 years and reserve requirements of about 15-20%.  This calculation represents an approximation, since it depends on system configuration and demand forecasts.  This reserve requirement is usually imposed on load serving entities.  In theory, reserve providers will invest in additional capacity up to the point that the reserve requirement is met.  This model has been used in the US.  However, the application of this model varies a lot across different power pools and regions.  Even for contiguous power pools, with significant power interchange and sharing of reserves, the approach to the reserve capacity problem varies a lot.  For example, in the recent mediation ordered by FERC on July 12 for the Northeast, involving Nepool, NYISO and PJM, it became clear that:  There are significant differences in how each pool handles the reserve requirements and payment processes.  Not only do the NYISO, Nepool and PJM processes differ, PJM itself uses two methods, one in PJM and another in PJM West. In all power pools, the topic of capacity payments (icap) has been subject to intense debate.  The methodologies are in state of flux. There is no such a thing as a single “benchmark”. The multiplicity of approaches does not allow adjoining power pools obtain maximum reliability for the existing system; nor does it allow vibrant trading activities across those power pools. Neither approach is perfect, they are simply regulatory fixes to what otherwise would be resolved through competitive solutions.  However, if an interim approach is deemed necessary, Enron sets out a proposal below. B - Enron’s Interim Capacity Approach Enron has three specific difficulties with icap proposals as implemented today.  First, implementation differs from pool to pool.  Second, icap can create a barrier to entry, and third, it is unnecessary as we note in the main body of the text above.  An interim proposal to amend icap payments needs to resolve the first two issues.  A finite interim term, such as 2 years, will achieve the last. As icap is implemented differently from region to region, resources have differing incentives and abilities to provide the product.   For example:  In PJM, reserve providers are more likely to sell their resource outside of PJM at the very times it is required due to the price caps in place. In NYISO, not all external resources are allowed to sell in NY – resources located in NEPOOL are excluded. The processes and timelines that the security coordinators use to procure capacity resources differ.  This makes it difficult to procure resources from other regions in much the same way that scheduling transactions between control areas is complex.  Therefore, the first requirement of any interim icap approach is that a standardized market and product must be applied across all regions.  Icap markets can also sustain commercial barriers to market entry because procuring icap resources is a complex task for third party competitors.  Incumbents that have historical obligations are able to bilaterally contract with internal resources in order to meet any obligation.  This task is more complex for third parties, as in most regions with capacity markets a participant must show that it has met the icap requirement by nominating its icap resources in the day ahead market.  If the participant does not meet this obligation, it faces penalty payments.  This forces participants into bilaterally contracting with generators who are potentially their competitors.  The simple solution to this problem is to identify icap for what it is – a public good .  As a result, the cost of icap should be charged initially to the transmission owner (or party that bills for transmission service) who then allocates the cost to all parties servicing consumers as a flat tax.  For example, if the cost of procuring icap within a region is $1 billion per year, the cost is divided by the gross consumed MWh for the previous year and charged as a fixed rate to all consumed MWh in the current year (any over/under recovery would be offset/funded by next year’s cost allocation mechanism). Therefore, the second requirement is that the interim icap requirement must not add barriers to entry, rather it should be recognized as a public good and allocated to all consumers. Enron’s approach below accommodates these two elements and is based on the second model described above.  It is based on this model because, as an interim approach, it will only exist for up to 2 years.  So, while model 1 possibly presents a more robust approach, the costs of implementing it likely outweigh the benefits. The aggregate icap quantity required should be the sole purview of the RTO.  The RTO is the one that has all the information on load forecasts and installed resources and is the one that performs the necessary analysis to determine reserve margins and obligations.  For example, in PJM, the staff would perform all calculations in terms of reserve requirements, and present the results to the Reliability Committee for approval, which would typically be approved unanimously. The RTO should therefore determine the annual icap obligation, then conduct an annual auction for the necessary resources and load curtailment bids.  This would be a similar process to the RTO’s involvement in determining revenue feasibility for financial transmission rights and LMP price setting processes – it receives bids, stacks them, determines the clearing price, and dispatches according to the stack.  It would be the same for the icap auction.  The RTO would not be a participant in the market as such and is only the facilitator. The total cost of icap would then be allocated to the load serving entities or transmission owners (any entity that charges for customers for embedded transmission) based on a pro-rata share of aggregate annual cost from the previous year (by dividing the cost by total consumed MWh).  They would in turn recover the cost from load (by charging each consumed MWh the derived cost) as a part of their revenue requirements (ideally it would appear as a separate line item on an end users bill and be identified as a "reliability tax" so they would see what it is costing them). This proposal, would accomplish the following: 1.   It would satisfy the reliability concerns of all participants. 2.   It would assess a "tax" on the load for reliability.  This both reflects the nature of the product and recognizes that load is the beneficiary of reliability. 3.   It would relieve the LSEs of the burden and obligation of providing icap, 4.  Deficiency penalties would not be required and accompanying deficiency rates would not need to be determined, 5.   Generators would still receive icap income, provided they are selected in the auction, 6.   Since the icap obligation is typically for a period in the future (in PJM, the icap requirements approved this year are for the year 2003), the much talked about "price signal" for new generation is provided, 7.   It allows the market to set the icap and not some artificial deficiency rate,  Market power issues associated with the existing icap markets are eliminated, It is simple to implement and administer, would not result in cost shifting and is consistent with the current approach to identifying icap requirements, and It is easy to remove at the end of the interim period.   Operating reserve products will still be required.   Nowhere has the subject of icap been more controversial than in New England.  From November 1998 through August 2000 ISO New England administered a bid-based auction market for icap.  The results were disastrous and led the ISO-NE to seek FERC authorization to eliminate both the icap auction market and the icap requirement altogether.  This request was based on the ISO-NE’s belief that prices in that market reflected an exercise of market power. Order Conditionally Accepting Congestion Management and Multi-Settlement Systems, 91 FERC ¶ 61,311, at 62,080 (June 28, 2000).   With respect to the auction market for icap, the Commission agreed with the ISO-NE in finding that “the existing auction is not useful and that it can produce inflated prices unrelated to the actual harm created by icap deficiencies.”  Id., at 62,081.  The auction market was thereafter eliminated on August 1, 2000. With respect to the icap requirement itself, however, an icap obligation has been provisionally retained by the Commission.  This has required the Commission to conduct extensive proceedings to establish a deficiency charge for failure to procure icap requirements in the bilateral markets.  Because the bilateral markets are unmonitored and because the deficiency charge is a highly artificial figure, the establishment of this charge has proven very controversial, requiring protracted proceedings before this Commission as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Throughout the controversy, however, the Commission has consistently looked to New England to develop a better reliability assurance mechanism than the outdated icap requirement.  In that regard, the Commission has consistently pointed New England toward examination of a forward reserve requirement as an alternative to icap.  “To the extent that forward reserve purchases take the place of proposals for an icap market with a deliverability requirement, this may prove to be a workable design alternative.”  Id., at 62,067.  See also Order on Proposed ICAP Deficiency Charge, 96 FERC ¶61,234, at 61,942-43 (August 28, 2001) (“We will also direct ISO-NE to file, on or before December 3, 2001, a compliance report in this proceeding regarding alternatives to the icap requirement, particularly the feasibility of a program of acquiring forward reserves and using demand side mechanisms to meet ISO-NE’s reserve capacity needs.”)  To date, however, neither NEPOOL nor ISO-NE has come forward with such a proposal.   Other examples of how icap and reserve market design can distort prices for consumers is provided by a recent study by Citizen’s for Pennsylvania’s Future (PennFutures E-Cubed) that shows that Duquesne Light “…will be charged $45 million per year to meet PJM West’s new capacity requirement called ACAP…”  Duquesne is moving from ECAR where there is only an operating reserve requirement   and no price caps to PJM West where there are price caps and an ACAP, with no discernible improvement in reliability.   While spot markets were not typically in use, hypothetical supply demand curves can be derived.     Typical supply/demand interaction.   This is entirely rational commercial behavior.  As the last suppliers in the stack must recover their return on capital and costs over a very limited timeframe, prices during these time periods would naturally increase.   However, price caps fortunately have not been used each time the spot market reacted to a supply shortage with high spot prices.  For example, there was no regulatory intervention in the ECAR markets in response to the price spikes of 1998.  As a result, the market responded with the addition of generation.   Contrary to the claims made by icap proponents, the lack of an icap market was not the cause of the sustained price excursion or reliability problems in California.  Instead, these problems were caused by the lack of the ability to adequately site generation, coupled with a retail market structure that shielded customers from wholesale price signals.  The large majority of reliability problems (blackouts) were caused by credit problems and not any sort of shortage of physical supply.  When retail rates were raised in June 2001, demand response finally occurred and the wholesale price of power dropped.   Samuelson, P. and Nordhaus, W. Economics. Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1998.   In 1996 New Zealand deregulated its wholesale electricity market.  The resulting market framework did not include any long run capacity adequacy related payments, yet it has seen the addition of timely resources to meet expected capacity requirements.  (See www.m-co.co.nz).  In addition, this concept has been proven to work in numerous capital intense sectors of the competitive economy.  Examples include petrochemical, petroleum and IT related industries.  These sectors are all critical industries that ensure a robust US economy.   Those consumers that require high levels of reliability will be specifically incentivized to do so to avoid spot market price spikes.  This is unlikely to be a new or onerous task for these consumers as most of them are likely used to managing such price risks as they buy/sell in competitive markets themselves. This solution will also allow customers that do not need high levels of reliability to offer the market “negawatts” benefiting system reliability.  Even small customers can participate through their LSEs.   The evidence from New Zealand suggests that both large industrial customers and retail aggregators enter into contracts to interrupt.  Interruptible load is now a material component of that market’s dynamics.   Producers do not need to be incentivized through explicit payments to build capacity.  They will make economic decisions about when, what and where to build plant to supply the market with a product that consumers are willing to buy.  All competitive industries, capital intensive or not, solve this issue in similar ways.  There is an explicit belief that suppliers will supply product if consumers are willing to pay them for it.  [Even residential food supply, which is at least as ‘essential’ as electricity, is managed via competitive solutions rather than by imposing capacity requirements].  , The current icap mechanism in New York, which includes deficiency penalties, costs New York consumers approximately $2 billion annually.   In New England this deficiency charge has been the center of controversy.  See 96 FERC 61,359.   The situation is further affected by the processes used by each region that make it difficult to procure capacity from outside the region to meet the obligation.    Where icap is specifically separated from energy, it is by definition a public good.  As such, the cost of the product should be recovered from as many participants as possible in a manner that minimizes distortions (i.e. by taxing participants).     Successful tenderers (which would include both generation and demand side management) would have to complete scheduled maintenance in the off peak season (schedule to be approved by the RTO), make offers into the spot market for every trading period over which they are contracted and face penalties if they fail to generate when called to operate.  In order to ensure that the capacity resources are able to generate when called, the RTO would be able to order operational tests on capacity resources twice yearly.  For example, when a gas-fired peaker is called to operate, the capacity must be ‘brought online’ within 15 minutes of the issue of the instruction (failure to meet comply with such tests would result in liquidated damages payments).

This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.  The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

David; Calger, Christopher F.; Nord, Sue Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap    Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."  The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

After a time of getting to know each other, he said, "How can I help you?" Those words surprised me coming from a man who obviously already had many requirements on his time. My first thought was that I was impressed with the individual. My next thought was to wonder whether it was a genuine offer or just an effort to impress me with his humility and Christian piety. I have since discovered he was sincere.  This encounter reminded me that each of us must be willing to give to others without a motive to get anything in return. It is simply an act of serving others. Jesus said that we must consider others more important than ourselves. When is the last time you did something for another without a motive of getting anything in return?  When King David came to offer a sacrifice and pray for the removal of a plague on Israel, he was given the opportunity to make the sacrifice without the cost of purchasing the sacrificial animals.  But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them. David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped (2 Samuel 24:24-25).  David, understanding the principle of giving, said he could not offer anything to God that did not cost him something. Otherwise, it was not a sacrificial gift.  When is the last time you sacrificed for another that it cost you something with no expectation of getting anything in return? We can all give something to others, such as our time, our money, or our expertise. This is real Christianity that models the Spirit of Christ. The next time you meet with someone, why not consider how you might be a blessing to that person. Why not ask, "How can I help you?"

In today's and tomorrow's devotionals, I would like to share with you 10 questions you'll want to ask yourself and pray about when you're faced with a decision. The first five are generic. They represent moral issues and godly wisdom that are normative for all times.    1 Have you prayed about it? Prayer was never intended to be a     fourth-down punting situation in which we ask God to bail us     out of our hasty decisions. It was intended to be a     first-down huddle. We aren't supposed to ask God to bless our     plans; we're supposed to ask God for His plans.    2 Is it consistent with the Word of God? In our culture,     ignorance of God's Word is no excuse since resources abound.     I believe that every home should have at least a concordance,     a Bible dictionary, a topical Bible, a good commentary, and a     study Bible with notes. Most pastors would love to share what     God has to say about a given matter. If they wouldn't, you     have called the wrong pastor!    3 Can I do it and be a positive Christian witness? A seminary     student stopped by my office and told me about a job he had     been offered. It would take care of his financial needs, but     he had some reservations concerning the sales pitch he was     required to use. I asked him if he could use the sales     technique and be a positive witness for Christ. He didn't     take the job.    4 Will the Lord be glorified? Can I do this and give glory to     God? In doing it, would I be glorifying God in my body? Am I     seeking the glory of man or the glory of God? Am I doing this     to be noticed by man or am I seeking to please the Lord?    5 Am I acting responsibly? God doesn't bail us out of our     irresponsibility. But when we are faithful in little things,     He will put us in charge of greater things. Don't get ahead     of God's timing or you will be over your head in     responsibilities. Seek to develop your life and message, and     God will expand your ministry.  Dear Lord, help me take a good, hard look at these questions and then avoid at all costs any compromise with Your will in my life today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Not only was Adam given a significant, authoritative role at creation, he also enjoyed a sense of safety and security. All his needs were provided for (Genesis 1:29). Adam was completely cared for in the garden. He had plenty to eat and there was plenty for the animals. He could eat of the tree of life and live forever in God's presence. He lacked nothing.  When Adam sinned, he lost that sense of safety and security. Before, he was naked and unashamed. After, he wanted to hide from God and cover up. The first emotion expressed by fallen humanity was fear.  Safety and security is another facet of our inheritance in Christ. We have the riches of His kingdom at our disposal and His promise to supply all our needs.  Adam and Eve also experienced a sense of belonging in that perfect garden. Adam apparently enjoyed intimate, one-on-one communion with God before Eve was created. Then God said it was not good for man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). So He gave Eve to Adam--and Adam to Eve--to enrich his experience of belonging.  Before the Fall, Adam and Eve had a sense of belonging. But after the Fall they felt rejected, experiencing a need to belong. It is one of our greatest needs today. Notice that what were attributes before the Fall became needs after the Fall.  I believe that a true sense of belonging today comes not only from knowing that we belong to God, but also from belonging to each other. When God created Eve He established human community. It's not good for us to be alone. Aloneness can lead to loneliness. God's preventative for loneliness is intimacy--meaningful, open, sharing relationships with one another. In Christ we have the capacity for the fulfilling sense of belonging which comes from intimate fellowship with God and with other believers.  Lord, thank You that all my needs for safety, security and belonging are fully met in You.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men. - (Proverbs 22:29)   The Lord has called each of us to be excellent in what we do. Those whom God used in the Kingdom as marketplace ministers were skilled and exemplified excellence in their field. Not only were these men skilled, they were filled with God's Spirit.  Then the Lord said to Moses, "See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts-to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship" (Exodus 31:1-5).  Consider Huram, the master craftsman of bronze in whom Solomon entrusted much of the temple designs. He was a true master craftsman (see 1 Kings 7:14).  Consider Joseph, whose skill as an administrator was known throughout Egypt and the world. Consider Daniel, who served his king with great skill and integrity. The list could go on-David, Nehemiah, Acquilla and Priscilla.  I recall the first issue of an international publication we began. It was common to hear the comment, "It doesn't even look like a Christian magazine." They were saying the quality and excellence exceeded what they equated to Christian work. What a shame. Has inferior quality become synonymous with Christian work?  May we strive for excellence in all that we do for the Master of the universe.  Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving (Colossians 3:23-24).  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * *  How can you experience God in your work? Why do most of us tend to segment our spiritual life from our work life? Can I really know God's will for my life? How can I make decisions that will be blessed by God? Why do most Christians in the workplace live a defeated life?

There is also overwhelming evidence that there is a need for all persons to attain and maintain an adequate fitness level.   However, before beginning an exercise program it is important to:   Consult with your physician before significantly increasing your level of physical activity. Undergo a fitness assessment.  The results of the assessment will serve as a central foundation for your exercise prescription.    By following these important steps, a safe exercise program can be suggested for you to pursue.      As a member of the Enron Body Shop, please read and sign the following waiver and release in recognition of the importance of checking with your personal physician prior to starting an exercise program and understanding the risks associated with engaging in an exercise program.

A few years ago I was speaking in a Southern California church on the subject of the New Age Movement. My text was 1 Timothy 4:1. After my message, I was surrounded at the front of the sanctuary by people wanting to hear more about freedom from spiritual conflicts caused by demonic influences.  Sitting about halfway back in the sanctuary was a 22-year-old woman who had been weeping uncontrollably since the service ended. As I approached the young woman, I could hear her sobbing, "He understands! He understands!"  later Nancy described to me her horrible childhood, which included an abusive father and a grandmother who identified herself as a black witch. "When I was three years old, I received my guardians--spirit guides," she continued. "They were my companions, telling me how to live and what to say. I never questioned if having spirit guides was anything but normal until my mother took me to Sunday school."  "Would you like to get rid of your spirit guides?" I asked.  There was a long pause. "Will they really leave, or will I go home and be thrashed by them again?"  "You will be free," I assured her. An hour later Nancy was free.  Nancy's experience is not an obscure, erratic blip in the contemporary Christian community. In face, in more than 20 years of ministry as a pastor, counselor, seminary professor and conference speaker, I have met and ministered to more Christians in bondage to the dark side of the spiritual world than you may believe. Christians are woefully unprepared to deal with the dark world of Satan's kingdom or to minister to those who are in bondage to it.  Yes, as Timothy warned, "deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons" are real. But as you daily embrace Christ and His truth, you will be able to recognize Satan's lies and choose the truth.  Thank You, Jesus, for being the way, the truth, and the life. I know You are my weapon for overcoming the evil one.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

He wanted understanding of this vision. He set himself out to understand the vision by fasting for three weeks. Three days after his three weeks of fasting, a messenger of God appeared to Daniel. The messenger explained that Heaven had heard his prayer from the first day, but the angel was temporarily prevented from coming by the prince of Persia, a demon angel, who sought to thwart God's messenger from coming to Daniel.  There are times in our lives when we must set ourselves to seeking God with all our hearts. It is in these times that we hear from Heaven in ways we may never have experienced before. Daniel's perseverance in prayer was rewarded with a personal encounter with Heaven. However, in order to receive from God, Daniel had to be left alone, his strength removed, and be placed in a helpless condition. When we have no ability in our own strength to move Heaven or the events around us, we are in position to hear from Heaven. It is the acknowledgment of our humanity and our frailness that places us in a position to have a personal encounter with the living God.  Do you need a personal encounter with God today? Do you need God to intervene on your behalf? Seek Him with all your heart. Demonstrate to Him you are serious. Get alone and acknowledge your helpless condition before Him. He will reward you with His presence.     Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

A seminary student stopped by my office to tell me he was having difficulty getting to school on time. What should have been a five-minute drive lengthened to 45 minutes because a voice in his mind kept telling him to turn at intersections. Not wanting to disobey what he perceived to be the "still, small voice of God," he was treated to a tour of the city almost every morning.  A pastor's wife, desperately needing the comfort of the Holy Spirit and desiring His leading, passively believed that whatever entered her mind was from God. She soon found herself bound by fear and plagued by condemning thoughts.  These examples underscore the wisdom of John Wesley's words: "Do not hastily ascribe things to God. Do not easily suppose dreams, voices, impressions, visions or revelations to be from God. They may be from Him. They may be from nature. They may be from the devil. Therefore, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be from God" (Martin Wells Knapp, Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).  In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, "Praise the Lord, someone understands." It's freeing to know this truth, because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win that war.  Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my responsibility to think upon that which is true.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

How pathetically unaware we are of the biblical prominence of music in the spiritual realm. It is interesting to note that whenever the evil spirit came upon King Saul, David (the heir apparent to Israel's throne) would play his harp and the evil spirit would depart (1 Samuel 16:23). When Elisha was about to inquire of God, he said, "'Now bring me a minstrel.' And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him" (2 Kings 3:15). During the reign of David, more than 4000 musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day (1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:5). It is the mark of Spirit-filled Christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the Lord and speak to each other in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs (Ephesians 5:18, 19).  On the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of secular music. A former satanic high priest showed me numerous symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and bondage to Satanism. He told me that about 85 percent of today's heavy metal and punk music groups are "owned" by Satanists. They have unwittingly sold themselves to Satanism in exchange for fame and fortune. Few of these artists actually practice Satanism, but most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the godless message in their music.  God created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it. Our ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain. Some sounds irritate us; others soothe us. There is music that makes you want to march and music that puts you to sleep. Even without lyrics, music with harmony and order can affect the nervous system positively while discord produces a negative effect.  What role does music play in your life? Are you filling your mind and home with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs? Or are you allowing destructive secular music to rob you of your joy and vitality in the Lord?  You are the God who sings over me, Lord. Thank You for the gift of music and for the songs You give me in the night.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. - (1 Corinthians 15:58)   There is a paradigm shift going on among a remnant of businesspeople today. That paradigm shift is a focus on using our business and work life as a platform for ministry versus a platform solely for material success. There is a remnant of businesspeople throughout the world today who understand their birthright in the marketplace is to reflect Christ fully in and through their work. It is reflected by a commitment to use their resources and skills to provide a product of excellence with the overall motive to affect people for Jesus Christ. The difference is that these individuals have an overriding ministry objective to their work.  When the apostle Paul tells us to fully work unto the Lord, he does not mean we must be working as missionaries in "full-time Christian effort." He understands that all of life is holy and sacred to God. If our motive is to serve God where we are, then our labor "in the Lord is not in vain."  As you begin your work today, ask God if you are working with the primary motive of reflecting His life and character through your work on this day. Let nothing move you from this motive being central to your activity. The Lord will reflect His power and leading in and through your life when this becomes your primary motive.

I have included the information to provide your network administrator in regards to your trouble with the Super StreamMachine.  Super StreamMachine uses a socket connection via the HTTP 1.0 protocol on port 80.  Upon initial connectivity we utilize standard HTTP headers to initiate the login and response.  It appears that there are certain caching engines that disallow this mechanism as they require all message packets to be HTTP 1.0 compliant. We do not send a full HTTP header on all messages and thus is being blocked by the cache engines.  You would either have to be able to get to our server directly without being routed through the cache engine or the cache engine tuned to allow non HTTP packet checking after the initial connection is generated.  Here is the IP address for Super StreamMachine:  204.107.120.3.  If your network administrator can check to see if this IP is being blocked by the cache server, this may be the answer to your problem.  If you have further concerns or inquiries, please reply to this message or call Client Services at (800) 669-3900 or (402) 970-5805.  Thank you for choosing Ameritrade!  Sincerely,  Josh Wells Client Services/Technology Support Ameritrade   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The next piece of armor is the shoes of peace. When you receive Christ, you are united with the Prince of Peace. You have peace with God right now (Romans 5:1), but the peace of Christ must also rule in your heart if you are going to live victoriously, and that is possible only when you let the Word of Christ richly dwell in you (Colossians 3:15, 16).  The shoes of peace become protection against the divisive schemes of the devil when you act as a peacemaker among believers (Romans 14:19). Peacemakers bring people together by promoting fellowship and reconciliation. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God" (Matthew 5:9). Anyone can divide a fellowship, but it takes the grace of God to unite us in Him.  Too many Christians insist on common doctrine as the basis for fellowship. They reason that if we don't think the same and believe the same, there is no basis for peace. But common doctrine isn't the basis for fellowship; common heritage is. We're all children of God. If you wait to fellowship with someone until you agree perfectly on every point of doctrine, you'll be the loneliest Christian on earth. Instead of insisting on the unity of the mind, preserve the unity of the Spirit by taking the initiative to be the peacemaker in your relationships (Ephesians 4:3).  Some people like to play the devil's advocate in their relationships and churches. I ask, Why? He doesn't need any help! In His high priestly prayer, Jesus prayed, "I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, that the world may know that Thou didst send Me" (John 17:23). We have the promise that "the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" (Romans 16:20). Ask God to use you to bring unity to your relationships by making you a peacemaker.  Heavenly Father, use me today to bring unity to Your family. Enable me to be a peacemaker.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

(Ephesians 6:14).  The second piece of armor God has provided for us is the breastplate of righteousness. When you put on Christ at salvation, you are justified before our holy God. It's not your righteousness but Christ's (1 Corinthians 1:30; Philippians 3:8, 9). So when Satan aims an arrow at you by saying, "You're not good enough to be a Christian," you can respond with Paul, "Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies" (Romans 8:33). Your righteousness in Christ is your protection against Satan's accusations.  Even though we rejoice in our position of righteousness in Christ, we are well aware of our deeds of unrighteousness when we think, say, or do something apart from God. Standing firm in our righteousness requires us to live in continuous agreement with God according to 1 John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Confession is different from saying "I'm sorry" or asking forgiveness. To confess (homologeo) means to acknowledge or to agree. You confess your sin when you say what God says about it: "I entertained a lustful thought and that's a sin"; "I treated my spouse unkindly this morning and that was wrong"; "Pride motivated me to seek that board position and pride doesn't belong in my life."  Satan will make confession as difficult for you as he can. He will try to convince you that it's too late for confession, that God has already erased your name out of the book of life. That's another one of his lies. You're in Christ; you're already forgiven. You are the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21), and He will never leave you. Your confession of sin clears the way for the fruitful expression of righteousness in your daily life. We should be like Paul, who said, "I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men" (Acts 24:16).  Lord, I put on the breastplate of righteousness today and seek to maintain a blameless conscience before You and the people around me.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Wed, 16 May 2001 11:32:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Jeff King To: Joe Quenet Subject: Load Forecasting Technology X-SDOC: 940865 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-435.eml  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff King/Corp/Enron on 05/16/2001 09:32  AM ---------------------------   Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM To: robert.benson@enron.com, jeff.king@enron.com, kyle.schultz@enron.com,  doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,  paul.j.broderick@enron.com, tom.may@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com cc:    Subject: Load Forecasting Technology   To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results.   	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.  	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.  	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

Husbands, love your wives . . . Fathers, do not exasperate your children (Colossians 3:18-21).  God works in our lives primarily through committed relationships. Your family is the primary laboratory for your character development. This is precisely the order of Scripture: Establish your identity in Christ, then focus on living out who you are at home. Notice the order in Colossians 3:10-25;    * God's great goal for His children is that we conform to His     image: "Put on the new self" (verse 10). Our identity is no     longer in racial, religious, cultural or social ties: "There     is no distinction . . . but Christ is all and in all" (verse     11).    * Character is the focus of development once identity is     established: "Put on a heart of compassion, kindness,     humility, gentleness and patience" (verse 12).    * Character is developed in the context of relational living:     "Bearing with one another, and forgiving each other" (verse     13).    * Love is the highest level of character development: "Beyond     all these things put on love" (verse 14).    * The means by which all this is accomplished is Christ in you:     "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts . . . Let the     word of Christ richly dwell within you" (verses 15, 16).    * The primary setting for character development is the home:     "Wives, be subject to your husbands . . . Husbands, love your     wives . . . Children, be obedient to your parents . . .     Fathers, do not exasperate your children" (verses 18-21).  As a parent, you are not just shaping your child's behavior, you are developing his character. Training a child means discipling him to be Christlike. Don't be a phony at home; your spouse and children will see right through it. You can't model perfection, but you can model growth.  Lord, help me be the spouse and parent You want me to be by remaining committed to be a growing child of God.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The very suggestion of their instruction may have brought laughter or even anger for proposing the idea.  I imagine that the disciples may have felt this way when Jesus responded with this comment when they asked him how they were going to feed the 5000 who stayed around to hear him speak. The disciples suggested a logical answer to the problem, "Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat" (Mk 6:36).  That wasn't the answer Jesus wanted. He saw the need of the people. He had compassion on them. He wanted to solve the problem with a Kingdom response, not logic. He asked them what they had in their hand.  So often what we already have in our hand is what Jesus wants us to use to solve our problems. We must add faith to what we already have in our hand. Then we will see the gospel of the Kingdom manifested to solve problems in a supernatural way. Jesus wanted to meet a need in which God would receive the glory. Sending the people away did not meet the need, nor did it bring glory to the Father.  Do not settle for the gospel of salvation only. Jesus came that we might experience the gospel of the Kingdom in its fullest sense. Our job is to look past our logical reasoning and see how God might want to solve our problem in a supernatural way.

Yet even this hunger is born from God. Elisha hungered after God. Elisha saw many miracles as Elijah's servant. But he wanted more. He wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit. When he asked Elijah for this, the prophet responded, "You have asked a difficult thing." It wasn't because it couldn't be granted. Elijah knew that with great anointing came a great weight of responsibility and difficulty.  Second, humility comes before honor. Elisha was known as the "servant of Elijah." How would you like to be known as "the servant of John"? Your name is not even mentioned. This was the preparation of Elisha. It has been the preparation of many men of God. Consider Joseph, the servant of Pharaoh. Consider David, the servant of Saul.  Third, Elisha committed himself totally to his calling. The Scripture says when Elisha was called to join Elijah, the younger man left his farm business completely. He slaughtered his oxen and had a great feast for the community. It was all or nothing. He could not fall back on his farm trade if his new venture didn't work. This demonstrates Elisha's pioneer spirit in stepping out, not knowing what was ahead.  Do you want greater anointing in God? "You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart. I will be found by you" (Jer. 29:13-14a). Begin thirsting for God's anointing in your heart today. This is the starting place.

I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

It is a description of God's formula to refine the human heart in order to bring out its finest qualities. The significant leaders who make the greatest mark for the Kingdom had to experience their own crucible and fire. Without it, the dross can never be removed from the human heart. Without it, the encumbrances weigh us down. God understands the human heart. He understands that for us to become all that He hopes for us, there are seasons of fire. Joseph went through many tests. Succeeding in the test qualified him for greater responsibility. The greater the use in the Kingdom the greater the crucible to prepare the right foundation. Some of God's greatest crucibles are found in the marketplace where we live every day: the employee who betrays our trust, the client who refuses to pay, the vendor who falls short of our expectations.  Each of these is God's tests to find out how we will respond. What tests are being brought your way today? His grace has been provided that we might pass the tests that He brings before us. Should we fail, we need not fear. His grace is sufficient for this as well. Ask God for the grace to walk with Him in whatever tests He has placed before you this day. He is able to accomplish what He wants for you.  Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

Adam was created physically and spiritually alive. He possessed eternal life from his first breath and enjoyed God's abiding presence in the Garden of Eden.  Furthermore, unlike the animal kingdom that operated by divine instinct, Adam was created in the likeness of God with a mind, emotions and will, giving him the ability to think, feel and choose. No other created being can make that claim.  After creating Adam, God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone" (Genesis 2:18). So He created a suitable helper for him: Eve. They both enjoyed a sense of belonging to God and each other. Not only that, God gave them a purpose: to "rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth" (Genesis 1:26). Adam and Eve didn't have to search for significance; they had it in their relationship with God. And because God was present with them, they lived in perpetual safety and security.  Eternal life, identity, purpose, significance, security and a sense of belonging are all attributes of mankind created in the image of God. Adam and Eve experienced these attributes in full measure, and we were destined to enjoy them too. But when Adam sinned, he died spiritually and forfeited everything God had provided. Being separated from God, Adam's glowing attributes became glaring needs.  As children of Adam born separated from God, we come into the world with these same glaring needs. We wander though life striving to make a name of ourselves, looking for security in temporal things, and searching for significance apart from God. Is it a hopeless quest? No! We are able to fulfill these needs by establishing a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ. Everything Adam enjoyed in the garden before he sinned is now at our disposal.  Loving heavenly Father, thank You for sending Jesus to die for my sin so I may have eternal life. And thank You that in Christ my need for identity, significance, security and a sense of belonging can be met.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Two significant events in my life brought into clear focus the priority of relationship over achievement. Before being called into the ministry, I worked as an aerospace engineer on the Apollo program. I will never forget the day the lunar lander touched down on the moon. This bold headline dominated the front page of the Minneapolis Star: "Neil Armstrong Lands on the Moon." It was an achievement I was proud to be part of.  But the really big news came months earlier on page 7 in the third section: "Heidi Jo Anderson, born to Mr. and Mrs. Neil Anderson, Northwestern Hospital, March 12, 1969." That may not sound like big news to you, but it was to her mother and me. Heidi totally took over my den and captured an entire shelf in the refrigerator. She altered our sleeping pattern and restricted our social calendar. But she was ours to hold, to hug and to care for.  What does God care about moon shots? They are deeds to be outdone. Somebody will always come along and do it better, faster and higher. What God cares about is little people like Heidi Jo Anderson because they will be with Him forever.  The second significant event in my life was receiving my first doctoral degree. But it turned out to be one of the most anticlimactic days of my life. I heard no applause from heaven, and I don't believe my achievement added so much as an asterisk to my name in the Lamb's Book of Life. I was a child of God before that day and I was still a child of God afterward.  But what happens in heaven when one sinner repents? Applause! Why? Because a relationship with God is eternal, while earthly achievements last only for time. Have you sacrificed the eternal to gain the temporal? Have you ignored personal and spiritual relationships in your pursuit of human achievements? Relationships must always have a higher priority than temporal achievements.  Lord, amidst the busyness of my schedule and clutter of my possessions, help me cherish and nurture my relationships today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Do you recall the last time someone cut you off in traffic, or you were forced to wait in line because someone up front got held up? Perhaps your employer did something that was downright unfair. Anger can result from many circumstances.  A friend once told me that anger is like warning lights on the front of your car dashboard. They signal that there is something going on under the hood, and we should take a look to examine the source of the problem. Anger can be traced to a few sources. First, when we lose control of a circumstance that we have placed certain expectations on and those expectations do not result in our desired outcome, we are tempted to get angry. The source of this type of anger is both fear and protection of personal rights. You see, when we believe we have a right to something, we have not given the Lord permission to allow an outcome different from what we want. If an outcome is different from our expectations, this may stimulate fear.  For instance, if a vendor failed to deliver an important job on time due to something out of his control, you may respond out of anger. Please know that the source of your anger is the fear of what might happen to you or what this might say about your abilities to manage a project. You no longer are in control of the circumstance and this creates fear in you.  The next time you get angry ask the Lord what is the source of that anger? Did the Lord allow that failure to let you see what is "under your hood"? God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of love, power, and a sound mind (see 2 Tim. 1:7). Give up your rights to expectations that God never gave you. You will find a new freedom in Christ you never knew you could have.

With news of carrier approval expected soon, there could be a huge win here. PCPH was over $6 earlier this year and that was well before all the recent exciting events.   PC-EPHONE HONORED AT COMDEX FALL 2001  SAN DIEGO--Nov. 15, 2001--PC-EPhone, Inc. (OTCBB: PCPH Frankfurt: NL1, WKN 589864) is pleased to announce that it has been honored at Comdex Fall 2001 in Las Vegas by industry experts.

The article referred to the PC-EPhone device as ``light years ahead of the rest'' and stated that ``PC- EPhone has bestowed upon us a historical moment to view a product of such magnitude in design and innovation.'' The full article can be accessed at http://www.positiveimagenews.com/comdex/pcephone/index.html.   In addition, for an unprecedented second year the PC-EPhone device was selected a finalist for ``Best of Comdex''. This year the PC-EPhone device was nominated in the Mobile/Handheld System category along with products from Toshiba and Handspring. Last year the device was the finalist in the ``Best of Comdex'' Wireless/Mobile Product category.  ``We are pleased and honored to have been selected and nominated by leading industry experts for such recognition,'' said David Meltzer, CEO and President, of PC- EPhone, Inc. ``We are proud of our development partner, Cyberbank Corp., and their dedication to making such fine, world-class wireless devices.''  About PC-EPhone, Inc.  PC-EPhone, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, is the exclusive U.S. and Canadian distributor of the PC- EPhone device and the Company also has the right to co- develop Cyberbank Corp.'s (the developer of the PC-EPhone and a major shareholder of the Company) future devices.

In fact, we will sell our positions in any companies advertised before they reach such target prices. The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should observe the trading behavior of any advertised company prior to investing.

Michael Kane asked me to contact you in regards to a  few positions that I know of in the market place.  I have a few questions  for you.  Would you be open to relocation?  What would you say your  strongest region of trading is?   If you can help me by answering  these questions, I should be able to find a fit in the openings I know  of.

A primary element in our protection from Satan and evil is the armor that God has provided for us and instructed us to put on in Ephesians 6:13-17. When we put on the armor of God, we are really putting on Christ (Romans 13:12-14). And when we put on Christ, we take ourselves out of the realm of the flesh, where we are vulnerable to attack, and we place ourselves within the dominion of Christ, where the evil one cannot touch us. Satan has nothing in Christ (John 14:30), and to the extent that we put on Christ, the evil one cannot touch us (1 John 5:18). He can only touch that which is on his own level. That's why we are commanded, "Make no provision for the flesh" (Romans 13:14), meaning "Don't live on Satan's level."  It would appear from the verb tenses in Ephesians 6;14, 15, that three of the pieces of armor--belt, breastplate and shoes--are already on you: "having girded . . ."; "having put on . . ."; having shod. . . ." These pieces of armor represent the elements of your protection made possible when you receive Jesus Christ and in which you are commanded to stand firm. The Greek tense of "having" signifies that the action it refers to was completed before we were commanded to stand firm. That's the logical way a soldier would prepare for action: He would put on his belt, breastplate and shoes before attempting to stand firm. Likewise, we are to put on the full armor of God after having already put on Christ.  When you read through Ephesians 6:10-20, you will notice the emphasis on the active part we must play on behalf of our own spiritual defense: "be strong" (verse 10); "put on" and "stand firm" (verse 11); "take up," "be able," "resist," and "stand firm" (verse 13); "stand firm" (verse 14); "taking up" (verse 16); "take" (verse 17)' "pray at all times" and "be on the alert" (verse 18).  Over the next several days, we will consider each of the six pieces of armor from Ephesians 6:13-17.  Teach me my responsibility in spiritual warfare, Lord, that I may be strong in You and in the strength of Your might.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.  ·	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ·	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.  We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.     *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Unfortunately, the idyllic setting in the Garden of Eden was shattered. Genesis 3 tells the sad story of Adam and Eve's lost relationship with God through sin. The effects of man's fall were dramatic, immediate and far-reaching, infecting every subsequent member of the human race.  What happened to Adam and Eve spiritually because of the Fall? They died. Their union with God was severed and they were separated from God. God had specifically said: "You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die" (Genesis 2:17 NIV). They ate and they died.  Did they die physically? No. The process of physical death was set in motion, but they were alive physically for several hundred more years. They died spiritually; their souls were separated from God. They were banished from God's presence. They were cast out of the Garden of Eden and guarding the entrance were cherubim waving a flaming sword (Genesis 3:23, 24).  After Adam, everyone who comes into the world is born physically alive but spiritually dead, separated from God. Paul wrote, "As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live" (Ephesians 2:1 NIV).  How did Jesus remedy this problem? In two dramatic, life-changing ways. First, He died on the cross to cure the disease that caused us to die: sin. Romans 6:23 begins, "The wages of sin is death." Then He rose from the dead to give us spiritual life. The verse continues, "But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Jesus Himself said, "I came that they might have life" (John 10:10).  The bad news is that , as a child of Adam, you inherited spiritual death. But the eternally good news is that, as a child of God through faith in Christ, you will live forever because of the life He has provided for you.

The MISO plans to start up its OASIS node to accept new requests on November 27, 2001.  Prior to starting the MISO node,  the existing OATT service that is confirmed on the MISO Transmission Owner OASIS nodes will be consolidated and placed on the MISO node with MISO shown as the Transmission Provider  Consolidating the Queues  Existing OATT service that is not confirmed on the MISO Transmission Owner OASIS nodes but is still in an active state will also be consolidated and placed on the MISO node with MISO shown as the Transmission Provider.   This process of consolidating these active,  but not confirmed reservations at the time the MISO OASIS node goes live also establishes a queue time (based on the time the request was originally submitted on the Transmission Owner OASIS node)  for all requests that have been submitted,  but not completely processed and confirmed as of the date that the MISO node becomes live.   Grandfathered Service  In addition,  MISO has received grandfathered (i.e. service sold prior to the Transmission Owner OATTs being placed in service) transmission service information from the MISO Transmission Owners,  and to the extent that we have received this data,  this will be placed on the MISO OASIS with each of the Transmission Owners being listed as the Transmission Provider for these grandfathered reservations (i.e. they will be placed on the Transmission Owner “page” of the MISO OASIS node).  If the grandfathered transmission service reservations had been placed on the Transmission Owner OASIS nodes previously,  MISO has received these assignment reference numbers from the Transmission Owners and these will be placed on the Transmission Owner page of the MISO node and will not be consolidated as described above.   The MISO Transmission Owners need to review these grandfathered reservations and inform MISO of any discrepancies or omissions.  MAPP Schedule F service that involves MISO Transmission Owners will continue to be sold by MAPP up to the date that the MISO tariff becomes effective (January 1).  To the extent that MAPP Schedule F service is confirmed prior to the MISO Tariff becoming effective,  the MAPP Schedule F service will be considered grandfathered service and will continue according to the terms of the service sold.   Requesting Service from November 27 through January 1  When the MISO OASIS node becomes live,  customers that need service for the period after January 1, 2002 (and in addition,  any weekly or monthly requests for the month of December) will make transmission service requests (as described in more detail below) on both the existing applicable Transmission Owner nodes (e.g. on the ECAR,  MAIN,  or MAPP nodes),  and on the MISO “page” on the MISO node.  Requests for service need to be made on both Transmission Owner and MISO nodes so that in the event that the MISO tariff does not go into effect on January 1,  as currently planned,  the transmission customers continue to have the transmission service they would need to conduct business in January and beyond.  Additionally,  it is necessary for customers to begin utilizing the MISO node in order to become familiar with the MISO OASIS node and business processes.  All new requests for transmission service within the MISO that include service on or after January 1, that are made between the start-up date of the MISO OASIS node (anticipated to be November 27), and before the effective date of the tariff (January 1), shall be submitted to both the existing applicable Transmission Owners’ OASIS pages and on the MISO “page” on the MISO OASIS node (Note that a single request on the MISO OASIS may require several individual requests on transmission owner OASIS nodes).  Customers should submit the requests first to the Transmission Owner node(s),  and then to the MISO node.  Entry on the MISO node will establish the queue position for competing requests.  MISO will also require the transmission customer to place in the customer comments field when the request is submitted,  the name of the Transmission Owner(s) and OASIS Assignment Reference number(s) for the requests that correlate to the MISO request.  Note that customers need to have gone through the customer registration process in order to submit requests on the MISO node.  MISO will ensure that when a request is made on the MISO node during this period,  that the customer comment field does indicate the Transmission Owner(s) and Assignment Reference number(s).  MISO will also periodically query the requests being made on the Transmission Owner nodes and will contact customers who are not performing this duel entry.  In the event that customers are not making the dual entries as required,  the customer can enter the request on the MISO node at a later time,  but will have their queue position established at the time of the entry on the MISO node.  In addition,  the “no later than” period of 30 days for monthly firm service for January 2002,  will be reduced to a shorter period of time.  Reducing the timing requirements still must provide enough time for the MISO to evaluate the request.  The exact time will be announced prior to December 1.   The transmission requests received during this interim period prior to January 1 will be processed as follows:   If a transmission service request start and stop date are both before the effective date of the tariff, the MISO Transmission Owner shall process the request and approve/disapprove as transmission provider and inform MISO of its actions.  MISO will set its OASIS status to the same status as the Transmission Owner(s).  MISO will query the Transmission Owner’s node periodically to see if the customer has confirmed the request.  If the customer has confirmed the request,  MISO will call the customer and ask that the customer also confirm the reservation on the MISO OASIS.   If a transmission service request start date is before  the effective date of the tariff and the stop date is after the effective date of the tariff, the Transmission Owner(s) and MISO will coordinate action to be taken on the requests.  Both MISO and the Transmission Owner(s) will need to approve this type of request.  The Transmission Owner(s) will review ATC for the period before the effective date of the MISO tariff,  and MISO will review AFC for the period on and after the effective date of the MISO tariff.   If a transmission service request start date is after the effective date of the tariff, the MISO shall have authority to process the request.  The Transmission Owner will set its OASIS status to the same status as MISO’s after being informed by MISO.  On January 1,  no more point-to-point requests will be made on the existing Transmission Owner OASIS Pages.   Customer and Transmission Owner Review of “Converted” Service  As mentioned above,  existing OATT service will have been gathered from the Transmission Owner OASIS pages and placed in the MISO node with MISO listed as the transmission provider.  Some “mapping” of information was necessary in order to make the information conform to the MISO methodology (e.g. PORs/PODs,  sources/sinks , products,  etc.).  The intent of this mapping was to give the customers the same service they had requested previously,  but to use consistent nomenclature.   Pricing of the transmission service was also changed to reflect MISO Tariff rates.   Customers and Transmission Owners need to review the data on the OASIS to ensure that the information was converted properly and to notify MISO of any real or perceived inconsistencies.   Furthermore,  because customers may have had several pieces of transmission service (from two or more MISO transmission owners) that would make up one piece of service if the customer had purchased service under the MISO tariff,  the customers must identify and inform MISO of “pieces” of service that should be combined into one piece of MISO service.  This should be done by December 31, 2001 by sending an e-mail to Joe Gardner,  Manager,  Tariff Administration at the Midwest ISO with the information of each of the pieces of service that should be combined.  Joe’s e-mail is jgardner@midwestiso.org.    Additionally,  many customers have “partial paths” of transmission service already reserved.  In this context,  partial paths refer to pieces of transmission service that have been purchased from individual transmission owners where the customer has only a piece of service and does not have a full path from source to sink.  These customers must inform MISO which pieces of transmission service fall into this category by sending an e-mail to Joe Gardner at the above e-mail address by December 31, 2001. MISO will assume that service not identified by customers as being partial paths,  are full paths of service and,  as such,  would not be scheduled as a partial path.  The scheduled use of partial paths are discussed in the MISO OATT Business Practices.  PORs/PODs,  and Interfaces  MISO has built its systems and set up its OASIS assuming that the Alliance RTO’s tariff would become operational at the same time as MISO’s tariff.  Based on recent announcements by  Alliance,  the Alliance RTO tariff will not begin at the same time as MISOs,  but rather at a later date.  This has several impacts on how MISO implements its tariff on Day One and on how customers need to do business in the Midwest.   The super-regional rate will not go into effect until the Alliance RTO starts their tariff.  The rates that MISO charges for service will reflect the rates without the SRA. MISO had set up its PORs and PODs on its OASIS (in response to customer desire) to reflect the Alliance RTO as a valid POR and POD and was planning to use the source/sink information to be more descriptive of where the ultimate source and sink were.  MISO will go on-line with this same methodology in anticipation of the Alliance RTO starting up in the near future.  Please see the MISO Open Access Tariff Business Practices for more information on this subject. Customers will be required to continue to purchase transmission service from individual Alliance Transmission Owners to the extent it is necessary between MISO “islands”.  For example,  for a transaction from Cinergy to Xcel (NSP),  only one MISO OASIS request will be necessary,  but the customer will need to purchase transmission service form Ameren (or a different contract path across the Alliance companies of the customer’s choosing) in order to have this service scheduled.

NETCO - 2002 ERCOT Business Plan   Executive Summary  Over the last year a fundamental shift has occurred in ERCOT resulting in a substantial opportunity for profit. Deregulation has taken the price risk associated with power supply away from the rate base and dispersed it through every component of the value chain. Faced with these newfound risks, market participants are now searching for new ways to manage their businesses. This presents an opportunity for NETCO to develop strategies to deal with these new market conditions.  Here is the restart/integration plan (cost estimated to be less than $2 million):  Start Physical Trading (Jan-Feb02) – Due to ERCOT not being regulated by FERC, the ERCOT marketing and trading team should be able to conduct physical business in 30 to 45 days with approximately 18 Tier 1 counterparties (some of which will be obtained by others since they are national accounts).  In this timeframe we should have physical power master trading agreements in place and the various certifications necessary with the State of Texas and ERCOT.    Expanding Business (Mar-Jun02) –  Master trading agreements with Tier 2 and some Tier 3 customers will be obtained.  Further certifications will be obtained to allow us to serve industrials and other retail players as well as become a participant in ERCOT committees to influence market decisions.  In addition, we will become qualified for the Transmission Congestion Right auctions to trade zonal basis.  Further Developing Business (Jul-Dec02) – Lastly, more Tier 3 customers will be approached for master contracts.  NETCO would be qualified for capacity auctions, REC trading, and delivering power into and out of ERCOT through HVDC ties.  Overall Strategy – Focus will be on building the trading business and landing as many profitable marketing deals as possible.  Emphasis will be placed on immediate earnings.  Market trends will be focused on to create structured products and opportunities for positions through trading products and customer deals.   Restart/Integration Plan The following action items need to be completed to facilitate NETCO’s power trading and marketing business in ERCOT.  High Priority – Necessary to Start Physical Trading in ERCOT (Jan – Feb02)   Action Item Description Timeline Cost Responsibility QSE Certification Enables scheduling with the ERCOT ISO 30-45 days $50,000+ collateral  Day/Pacheco PUCT Certification Registration with the State of Texas as a participant 30 days $1,000 Day/Pacheco ESCA Software Updates to current settlement and scheduling software 30 days $1.8 MM (note 1) Will/Day Counterparty Master Trading Agreements Enables financial and physical trades between NETCO and counterparties Tier 1 – 30 days (see below) collateral  Curry/Gilbert-Smith  Note 1:  This includes a $1.5 million outstanding liability to ESCA (software developer).  We will need to get various upgrades to the scheduling and settlement software from ESCA and believe that they will require this liability to be paid prior to any continuing development.

Therefore, the product list should be similar to EPMI’s prior products list (seller’s choice physical) plus various zonal and hourly financial products to be added after restart is completed.   Budget The ERCOT group’s budget would be similar to the East Power proforma adjusted for new ownership and business structure plus approximately $2 million in restart costs (see restart section above).  Costs for SG&A and expenses per employee should remain stable.  Revenue projections would need to take new VAR and ownership factors in consideration.

As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.   Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.  NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.  Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".  Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.    Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.  Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.  Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The mother of one of my seminary students was a psychic. She said to him once, "Jim, have you been praying for me?" "Of course I have, Mother." "Well, don't," she insisted, "because you're disturbing my aura."  I say pray on! We never know completely the effects of our prayers, but we do know that God includes prayer as part of His strategy for establishing His kingdom and ensuring our spiritual victory.  One of the most dramatic deliverances I have observed happened in a man who was a high priest in the upper echelons of Satanism. Six months after he was set free he gave his testimony in our church. At the close of his testimony I asked him, "Based on your experience on 'the other side,' what is the Christian's greatest strategy against demonic influence?"  "Prayer," he answered forcefully. "And when you pray, mean it. Fervent prayer thwarts Satan's activity like nothing else."  What is prayer? It is communication with God by which we express our dependence on Him. God knows what we need in our battle with the powers of darkness, and He is more ready to meet our needs than we are to ask. But until we express our dependence on Him in prayer, God may not act. In prayer we say, "You are the Lord, not I. You know what's best; I don't. I'm not telling You what to do; I'm asking." Prayer is a means by which God guides and protects His children.  Praying in the Spirit is God's way of helping us pray when we don't know how: "The Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us" (Romans 8:26). Helps (sunantilambano) depicts the Holy Spirit's role of coming alongside us in our condition of human frailty and spiritual vulnerability and bearing us to the other side of spiritual protection and victory.  Thank You, Lord, that prayer is such a powerful weapon in my arsenal against the powers of darkness.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230 6/8. He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be 10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived. Congratulations to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News. Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.  We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.  Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The Talmud, a collection of ancient rabbinic writings, relates the story of Rabbi Akiba, who was imprisoned. Rabbi Joshua brought him some water, but the guard spilled half of the container. There was too little water to both wash and drink, and Rabbi Akiba faced the possibility of death for lack of water if he chose to use the water for ceremonial washing. He reasoned, "He who eats with unwashed hands perpetuates a crime that ought to be punished by death. Better for me to die of thirst than to transgress the traditions of my ancestors!"  Jesus responded harshly to such reasoning: "You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!" (Matthew 23:24). The Lord cautions that the weightier matters of the law (such as justice and mercy) are overlooked when attention focuses on strict observances of religious practices. This leads to a corresponding negligence of the eternal laws of God. Jesus told people to pay more attention to cleansing their hearts and not be like their leaders who cleanse only their hands.  The laws of God are liberating and protective. They are restrictive only when they protect us from the evil one. The rules of any institution should ensure the freedom of each individual to reach his or her God-given potential. They should serve as a guide so we don't stray from our purpose, and they should protect us from those who abuse the system.  The principle that Jesus modeled could be stated as follows: If people are commanded to follow a traditional practice that makes life more difficult and no longer contributes to the purpose of the organization, then we must not participate as a matter of religious conscience. Jesus simply didn't observe such traditions, and He defended His disciples for not observing them as well.  Thank You for reminding me, Lord, that the law kills but the Spirit gives life.

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups.  Thanks.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Walton, Steve   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 10:17 PM       RTO Week Day 2 -- October 16, 2001 Transmission Planning & Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron. General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.   Opening Statements Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.   Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered. Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process. Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.   Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?   Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters. Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.   Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties. Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "tweaks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal. In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.  Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.    Thank you very much for your support.

Date: Wed, 16 May 2001 11:32:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Jeff King To: Joe Quenet Subject: Load Forecasting Technology X-SDOC: 940833 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-407.eml  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff King/Corp/Enron on 05/16/2001 09:32  AM ---------------------------   Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM To: robert.benson@enron.com, jeff.king@enron.com, kyle.schultz@enron.com,  doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,  paul.j.broderick@enron.com, tom.may@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com cc:    Subject: Load Forecasting Technology   To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

Date: Wed, 16 May 2001 11:30:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Jeff King To: Mike Carson, Chris Dorland Subject: Load Forecasting Technology X-SDOC: 940868 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-438.eml  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff King/Corp/Enron on 05/16/2001 09:30  AM ---------------------------   Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM To: robert.benson@enron.com, jeff.king@enron.com, kyle.schultz@enron.com,  doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,  paul.j.broderick@enron.com, tom.may@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com cc:    Subject: Load Forecasting Technology   To whom it may concern:  My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

It would not be the last time God's people would fall into idol worship. They had forgotten the great things God had done for them. This angered God so much that He was going to destroy the whole nation. Only one thing changed God's mind in the matter-Moses. Psalm 106:23 says, "...had not Moses, His chosen one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from destroying them." Moses was a man willing to stand in the gap, sacrificially, for those who were not deserving of such sacrifice. This sacrificial love by Moses is called for among His people today.  The prophet Ezekiel described another situation in which God's people fell into sin. God was ready to destroy the nation when He spoke to Ezekiel, asking him if there is a man willing to stand in the gap so that God would not have to destroy His people.  Judah was a man who stood in the gap on behalf of his younger brother Benjamin. Joseph held his brother Simeon hostage as insurance that the other brothers would bring Benjamin to Egypt. Judah had a long history of a me-focused life, but in this instance he came forward to stand in the gap for his younger brother. He responded to the anguish of his father, Jacob, by personally guaranteeing the safe return of both Simeon and Benjamin. Judah's sacrifice was rewarded (see Gen. 42-43).  Just as Christ did, we are to be those who will stand in the gap on behalf of others who are not aware of their own vulnerable condition. It is a proactive sacrificial position. Who is God calling you to stand in the gap for? Perhaps it is a mate; perhaps it is a business associate who has not come to know the Savior; perhaps it is a wayward child. Are you willing to become the sacrificial offering to God to change His plans of judgment because of your willingness to stand in their place? This is a hard teaching. This is what Jesus did for each of us. When we stand in the place of another, God moves because of our willingness to stand on their behalf. If we don't, His plans will go forward because He is a righteous and holy God who will honor His own word, even if it means destruction. Are you willing to stand in the breach of the wall for someone today? Perhaps you are the only person who will stand on someone's behalf.

Resist the devil and he will flee from you (James 4:7).  Daisy was one of the first persons I dealt with who was caught in spiritual conflicts and suffered from demonic influences. She was a Christian and a university graduate, but she had severe mental and emotional problems which developed after her father divorced her mother. Within a period of five years, Daisy had been institutionalized three times as a paranoid schizophrenic. After about three weeks of counseling with me, Daisy finally found the nerve to bring up the nighttime visitation of snakes.  "What about the snakes?" I asked.  "They crawl on me at night when I'm in bed," she confessed.  "What do you do when the snakes come?"  "I run in to my mother. But they always come back when I'm alone."  "Why don't you try something different," I continued. "When you're in bed and the snakes come, say out loud, 'In the name of Christ, I command you to leave me.'"  "I couldn't do that," Daisy protested. "I'm not mature enough or strong enough."  "It's not a matter of your maturity; it's a matter of your position in Christ. You have as much right to resist Satan as I do."  Daisy squirmed at the prospect. "Well, I guess I could do that." Daisy sighed, sounding like she had just agreed to take castor oil.  The next week when Daisy walked in she said, "The snakes are gone!" If her problem had been strictly a neurological or chemical imbalance, taking authority over the snakes in Jesus' name wouldn't have worked. But in Daisy's case, the problem was spiritual.  James wrote: "Resist the devil and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). But if you don't resist him, he doesn't have to go. Or if you just pull the covers over your head in fear and say, "O God, do something about these demonic influences," the evil spirits don't have to leave. Resisting the devil is your responsibility based on the authority you possess in Christ.  Dear Father, thank You for providing me with such wonderful power. Help me not to be afraid to use it for my sake and others.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.  Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).  If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   "Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Os Hillman, president of Marketplace Leaders, located in Atlanta, GA.

Signs and wonders validated the ministry of Jesus and the apostles. After quoting from the prophet Joel and demonstrating that the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost was biblical, Peter preached about Jesus of Nazareth as "a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst" (Acts 2:22). Of the apostles, Paul said, "the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles" (2 Corinthians 12:12).  However, signs and wonders would also accompany false teachers and false prophets (Matthew 7:21-23; 2 Peter 2:1-22). In fact, biblical references to signs and wonders in the last days are nearly all credited to false teachers, false prophets and false Christs (Matthew 24:11, 24). The false prophet in the tribulation "deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform" (Revelation 13:14).  Jesus is no longer with us in the flesh and there are no more apostles. Jesus identified the sign of a disciple as markedly different: "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).  Does this mean that signs and wonders have ceased? I certainly don't want to be identified with an evil generation that seeks only after a sign, but I also don't want to be associated with the powerless, anti-supernaturalism evidenced in Western rationalism. Both the power of God and the wisdom of God are expressed in Christ. Paul said, "For indeed Jews ask for signs, and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:22-24).  Lord, reveal to me the true source of my spiritual experiences. If they are not from You, I renounce them and command Satan to leave my presence.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.  Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. (1 Corinthians 3: 2,3).  The spirit of the fleshly person is identical to that of the spiritual person. The fleshly person is a Christian, spiritually alive in Christ and declared righteous by God. But that's where the similarity ends. Instead of being directed by the Spirit, this believer chooses to follow the impulses of his flesh. As a result, his mind is occupied by carnal thoughts and his emotions are plagued by negative feelings. And though he is free to choose to walk after the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit, he continues to involve himself in sinful activity by willfully walking after the flesh.  His physical body is a temple of God, but he is using it as an instrument of unrighteousness. He has the same troubling physical symptoms experienced by the natural person because he is not operating in the manner God created him to operate. He is not presenting his body to God as a living sacrifice. Since he yields to the flesh instead of crucifying it, the fleshly man is also subject to feelings of inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt.  Several years ago I did some research to discover how many Christians are still the victims of their flesh. I asked the same question to 50 consecutive Christians who came to me to talk about problems in their lives: "How many of the following characteristics describe your life: inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt:" Every one of the 50 answered, "All six." Here were 50 born-again, righteous children of God who were so bogged down by the flesh that they struggled with the same problems of self-doubt which inundate unbelivers who only live in the flesh.  If I asked you the same question, how would you answer? I imagine that many of you would admit that some or all of these six traits describe you. It is evident to me that a staggering number of believers are still confused about their spiritual identity in Christ and its implications for their daily lives. We are struggling with the behavior aspect of our growth because we are still struggling with the belief aspect of our growth: who we are in Christ.  Father, help me live above my fleshly desires today by exercising my spiritual inheritance at every temptation.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

It will be a time of great harvest on the earth, and this verse describes the catalyst. A plowshare is an agricultural instrument used to till the soil. At this point in history, it was a tool that spoke of one's vocation. However, the prophet was speaking of a time yet to come. The prophet described the plowshare as an instrument that will be turned into a sword. The sword is often used in the Bible to describe God's Word. The only way a plowshare can be turned into a sword is for it to go through extreme heat, and then the blacksmith must beat that plowshare into shape. Heat and punishment of the metal turns that plowshare into an instrument of battle. God must do this in each of our lives in order for us to be useable as a worthy sword. We are all in a battle-a spiritual battle. Paul describes our battle as one against the principalities of the unseen world. I believe God is going to raise up many in the marketplace to use their plowshare as a weapon of righteousness in these last days. That weapon won't be used for destruction, but as a weapon of love. That weapon of love will yield a great harvest in our lifetime. But this is only part of the story.  God is also going to turn our pruning hooks into spears. A pruning hook is used in two ways. First, it is used to prune a tree for greater growth and productivity. It is also used to cut the fruit from taller trees in which one cannot reach the fruit. This fruit from our vocation is going to be cast forth like a spear, but even more as seed planted to bring the harvest of which Joel speaks. Fruit from our business life is often the financial rewards generated. God wants to use our finances and everything else for His purposes. We must use our vocations and the fruit that comes from them as seed to bring the great harvest that God is planning.  How are you using your plowshare and your pruning hook for God's glory today? Ask God to show you how He wants to use your skills, resources, and relationships to prepare for the great harvest He has planned.  * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * * * * * *  New!

Biblically, life means to unite and death means to separate. When Adam became a living being, his soul was in union with his body. When he died, his soul separated from his body.  As long as you are alive, your soul is united with your body. But when that separation occurs, you do not cease to exist. Paul said that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:8). Your primary identity is not found in your physical existence. Paul said, "From now on we recognize no man according to the flesh" (2 Corinthians 5:16).  Even though your principal identity is more than physical, in this temporal life you cannot function without your physical body. Your immaterial self needs your material self, and vice versa. You need your physical brain to control your movements and responses, and you need your immaterial mind to reason and make value judgments. Your brain is like a computer and your mind is the programmer. The finest human brain can't accomplish anything in a corpse which lacks a mind. And the most brilliant mind cannot function in a brain damaged by Alzheimer's disease.  In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 Paul referred to the believer's body as a tent, the temporary dwelling place of the soul. Using his illustration, I must confess that my tent pegs are coming up, my poles are sagging, and my seams are becoming frayed! At my age I'm just glad that there's more to me than the disposable earth suit I walk around in.  You don't exist for your body; it exists for you. That's why Paul said, "I beat my body and make it my slave" (1 Corinthians 9:27 NIV). In order to fulfill your purpose for being here, you need to manage your body well through exercise, balanced diet and adequate rest.  Lord, help me to not overemphasize or underemphasize the significance of my physical life but stay in step with Your view.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The first piece of armor for the Christian warrior is the belt of truth. Jesus said, "I am . . . the truth" (John 14:6). And because Christ is in you, the truth is in you. However, continuing to choose truth is not always easy. Since Satan's primary weapon is the lie, your belt of truth (which holds the other pieces of body armor in place) is continually being attacked. If he can disable you in the area of truth, you become as easy target for his other attacks.  You stand firm in the truth by relating everything you do to the truth of God's Word. If a thought comes to mind which is not in harmony with God's truth, dismiss it. If an opportunity comes along to say or do something which compromises or conflicts with truth, avoid it. Adopt a simple rule of behavior: If it's the truth, I'm in; if it's not the truth, count me out.  When you learn to live in the truth on a daily basis, you will grow to love the truth because you have nothing to hide. You never have to cover up to God or anyone else; everything you do is in the light. Furthermore, when you live in the truth you dislodge the lies of Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44). Remember that if Satan can deceive you into believing a lie, he can control your life.  Jesus prayed, "I do not ask Thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one" (John 17:15). How? "Sanctify them in the truth; Thy Word is truth" (verse 17). You will only dislodge Satan's lies in the light of God's revelation, and not by human reasoning or research.  The only thing a Christian ever has to admit to is the truth. Walking in the light and speaking the truth in love may seem threatening to some. But in reality truth is a liberating friend and the only path to fellowship with God.  Forgive me, Lord, for entertaining lies and walking in darkness. Give me courage to face the truth and to speak the truth in love.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

When they crossed the Jordan River, their first battle was Jericho. God set a precedent with this battle by instructing them not to take any spoils from it. Unlike future battles, the fruits from this victory were to go into the treasury as a remembrance of their first victory in the Promised Land. In addition, the city of Jericho was to be a lasting monument to God's faithfulness. God instructed Joshua never to rebuild this city. If they or anyone in the future attempted to rebuild the city, the life of the firstborn would be required. Years later, Ahab attempted to rebuild this city and his firstborn died as a result. God never forgets to enforce His Word.  Is your work a lasting monument to the faithfulness of God in your life? Is it bringing glory to the Father? Are you giving the first fruits from your increase to God? God has encouraged us through this story to give the first fruits of our work to Him so that He will be glorified through our work. This is a tangible way for us to acknowledge that God is the source of all blessing.  * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * * * * * *  Do you know the 7 Stages of a Call from God?

Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble? - (Psalms 10:1)   One of the great mysteries of God is His ways. Some of His ways almost appear to bring us into the most difficult places, as if He were indifferent to our circumstances. It would appear that He is turning His head from our sorrows. These events in our lives have a particular objective to perform for us. That objective is to bring us to the end of ourselves that we might discover the treasure of darkness. "Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness" (Job 30:26).  When we are taken into these dark periods, we begin to see light that we never knew existed. Our sensitivities become heightened and our ability to see through spiritual eyes is illuminated. Unless we are taken into these times, our souls never develop any depth of character. We do not gain wisdom, only knowledge. Knowledge is gained through understanding; wisdom is gained through the experience of darkness.  After we go through these periods, we discover that God was, in fact, with us throughout the entire time. It does not feel or appear that He is there when we are in the midst of the dark periods. However, He is there walking with us. He has told us countless times that He will never leave us. However, when we are in those dark periods, it does not feel like He is there because He does not rescue us from the circumstances. He does this for our benefit in order that we might become more like Jesus. Jesus learned obedience from the things He suffered (see Heb. 5:8). What does that say about how you and I will learn obedience? Embrace the dark times and gain the wisdom that God intends for you from these times.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEW daily email: INSIGHTS from Bill Bright!

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.

Untie them and bring them to Me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them...." - (Matthew 21:2-3)   A donkey was an animal of commerce in Jesus' day. It was used to carry great burdens of goods from place to place and he was known as the "beast of the burden." This donkey no doubt was owned by a village businessperson. But Jesus told His disciples to fetch the donkey for "He had need of it." This donkey played an important part in Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It was a day that was the culmination of three years of ministry. Jesus chose to use a vehicle of commerce to bring Him into His most important public display.  We are entering a time in our own history in which God is saying to businesspeople, "Loose your donkey for My purposes. I have need of it." God is preparing His Church to be a vessel for ushering in a great harvest of souls. He is preparing His remnant of businesspeople, who are like a tribe within the Church, to be a major force in this great harvest.  "He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk" (Gen. 49:11-12). Is your donkey tied to the living Vine, the choicest branch of Jesus Himself? When we are tied to the living Vine, designed for His use, we will be useful in God's Kingdom. Jesus wants to free us from the bondage of business slavery; He wants us to walk in freedom so that others may see God's grace flowing through us and our place in the business world. Is your donkey available for His use?  Today, ask Jesus to allow the Vine to flow through you in every area of your life.

The Advisory Committee has formed a Commercial Operations Plan Work Group to review and propose solutions to any issues discovered in implementing the Commercial Operations Plan. The Commercial Operations Plan is:  On December 15, 2001, the MISO will become operational and will provide Security Coordination, Maintenance Coordination, Long Term Planning, Market Monitoring, Dispute Resolution, Operations Planning, Generation Interconnection, and Electronic Scheduling Services.  Note 1:  The Electronic Scheduling system is available now for parties to approve their schedules.  On December 1, MISO is requiring parties to approve their schedules using this system in order to have an orderly phase-in of MISO service.  Note 2: The MISO OASIS will be operational November 27th. Beginning November 27th, any transmission service requests should be made on both the MISO OASIS and the existing TO OASIS.  Beginning January 1, 2002, the Midwest ISO will provide MISO OATT Point-to-Point Transmission Service.  This service will be put into place in January to avoid splitting monthly transmission service into two half-months for two transmission providers, splitting the monthly accounting for both billing and settlements, and complicating records for year-ending 2001.  Billing for January Service will begin in February. The Electronic Scheduling System will be available to schedule MISO transmission service starting December 27th.   Beginning February 1, 2002, the Midwest ISO will provide MISO OATT Network Integration Transmission Service.  This will allow an orderly approach to new network service agreements and approval of designated resources.  Billing for February Service will begin in March.     If you have any questions concerning these key dates, please call or email me.  thanks john  John R.

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L              from Freedom in Christ Ministries  January 30  THE DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP  Encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you also are doing (1 Thessalonians 5:11).  Jesus' primary call to His disciples is seen in His words "Come to Me" (Matthew 11:28) and "Follow Me" (Matthew 4:19). Mark records: "He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and that He might send them out to preach, and to have authority to cast out the demons" (Mark 3:14, 15). Notice that Jesus' relationship with His disciples preceded His assignment to them. Discipleship is the intensely personal activity of two or more persons helping each other experience a growing relationship with God. Discipleship is being before doing, maturity before ministry, character before career.  Every Christian, including you, is both a disciple and a discipler in the context of his Christian relationships. You have the awesome privilege and responsibility both to be a teacher and a learner of what it means to be in Christ, walk in the spirit and live by faith. You may have a role in your family, church or Christian community which gives you specific responsibility for discipling others, such as husband/father, pastor, Sunday school teacher, discipleship group leader, etc. But even as an appointed discipler, you are never not a disciple who is learning and growing in Christ through your relationships. Conversely, you may not have an "official" responsibility to disciple anyone, but you are never not a discipler. You have the opportunity to help your children, your friend, and other believers grow in Christ through your caring and committed relationship with them.  Similarly, every Christian is both a counselor and counselee in the context of his Christian relationships. A good counselor should be a good discipler, and a good discipler should be a good counselor. Biblically, they are the same role. Your level of maturity may dictate that you do a lot of Christian counseling. But there will still be times when you need to seek or receive the counsel of other Christians. There will never be a day when we don't need each other.  Father, help me remember that I will never be so mature that I need not receive godly counsel from my brothers and sisters in Christ.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2002 16:06:12 +0100 (CET) Subject: KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants From: Enron General Announcements <mbx_anncenron@ENRON.com> To: DL-GA-all_enron_houston <DL-GA-all_enron_houston@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 57568 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-122.eml   The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.  The following guidelines must be followed: ·	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ·	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.  ·	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.   ·	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises.  ·	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.      If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

This applies to all applicable limits in contravention of a “Customer Warning Message” when checking availability in the relevant risk system without prior approval from an authorised CO if the commitment or engagement falls outside the criteria of any GCP, GMCP or regional credit policy. The Issuer Risk policy, GMCP 030-001 also sets out where credit discipline and sanctions in accordance with this policy apply. 2 SANCTIONS Limit excesses and other policy violations without prior approval from the appropriate authority will result in sanctions, namely:  for a first offence, or an offence after a considerable period without any violation, the SCO may agree that it is reasonable and proportionate for the trader or marketer to receive an informal verbal warning given by his/her manager in the presence of an appropriately senior CO.  The manager must agree that, in giving this warning, specific reference will be made to the fact that any future violations will, almost without exception, result in a formal written warning and could, if severe enough, result in summary dismissal.  Informal warnings will not generally be given in the case of very substantial excesses of amount or tenor, particularly with high risk counterparties for a second offence, or a first offence regarded as sufficiently serious by the SCO, the individual responsible will receive a formal written warning and a punitive fine may  be levied against the relevant Business Area.  The amount of the fine will be not less than any profit earned from the transaction(s) giving rise to the excess/violation.  The further allocation of this fine within the Business Area is at the discretion of the Business Area Head for a third offence, or the next offence after a written warning, the individual responsible will be liable to summary dismissal. Reckless and flagrant violations of policy or limits will always result in sanctions. "Passive excesses" will not give rise to disciplinary action:  passive excesses are limit excesses which arise, not from new trades, but from increases in the value of existing transactions due to changes in underlying market rates and prices or from the depreciation of the CHF against the currency of the trades. If a dealer has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that no limit will be exceeded or policy violated, but has been frustrated by systems errors or failures, has been misled or has made a justifiable error in a complex situation, rigid discipline may be waived at the discretion of the Regional CCO. The Group CCO must be advised of all written warnings issued and of any dismissals as a result of credit discipline.

Dan and Cindy were a fine young Christian couple who were preparing for ministry on the mission field. Then tragedy struck: Cindy was raped. As hard as she tried to get back to normal life, Cindy couldn't shake the horrible memories and feelings from her experience.  Six months after the tragedy, Dan and Cindy attended a church conference where I was speaking. During the conference Cindy called me in tears. "Neil, I know God can turn everything into good, but how is He going to do that?"  "Wait a minute, Cindy," I said. "God will work everything out for good, but He doesn't make a bad thing good. What happened to you was evil. God's good thing is to show you how you can walk through your crisis and come out of it a better person."  "But I just can't separate myself from my experience," she sobbed. "I've been raped, Neil, and I'll be a victim of that all my life."  "No, Cindy," I insisted. "The rape happened to you, but it hasn't changed who you are, nor does it have to control you. You were the victim of a terrible, ugly tragedy. But if you only see yourself as a rape victim for the rest of your life, you will never be free. You're a child of God. You can't fix the past, but you can be free from it."  All of us have a number of hurtful, traumatic experiences in our past which have scarred us emotionally. You may have grown up with a physically, emotionally or sexually abusive parent. Any number of traumatic, emotional events can clutter your soul with emotional baggage which seems to limit your maturity and block your freedom in Christ. You must renounce the experiences and lies that have controlled you and forgive those who have offended you.  As a Christian, you are primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross. You are literally a new creature in Christ. The "old you" is gone; the "new you" is here.  Father, thank You for working all things for good in my life, even the effects of evil attacks meant for my harm and destruction.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 06:00:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Crosswalk.com <marketplace@lists.crosswalk.com> To: jeff.king@enron.com Subject: TGIF Marketplace Meditation -- The Door of Full Surrender X-SDOC: 940806 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-385.eml  T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T Marketplace Meditations by Os Hillman  The Door of Full Surrender  But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold. - (Job 23:10)   I was recently sitting with the leader of a marketplace organization as he described a question he poses to businesspeople. "What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance. "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Cor. 4:17).     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

What does the Bible specifically say about our nature? The Greek word for nature is used in this way only twice in the New Testament. Ephesians 2:1-3 described the nature we all shared before we came to Christ: "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins . . . and were by nature children of wrath." What was your basic nature before you were born again spiritually? You and every other Christian "were by nature children of wrath," dead in sin, subject to Satan's power, living completely to fulfill sinful lusts and desires. This is the condition of every unbeliever today.  The second occurrence of the word is in 2 Peter 1:4 describing our nature after we came to Christ: "He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, in order that by them you might become partakers of the divine nature."  When you came into spiritual union with God through your new birth, you didn't add a new, divine nature to your old, sinful nature. You exchanged natures. Salvation isn't just a matter of God forgiving your sins and issuing you a pass to heaven when you die. Salvation is regeneration. God changed you from darkness to light, from sinner to saint. There is a newness about you that wasn't there before. If God hadn't changed your identity at salvation, you would be stuck with your old identity until you died. How could you expect to grow to maturity if you didn't start as a transformed child of God? Becoming a partaker of God's nature is fundamental to a Christian's identity and maturity.  We are no longer in Adam; we are in Christ. We can still choose to walk according to the flesh, but why should we want to? "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him" (Romans 8:9).  Lord, may my understanding of who I am in Christ grow today so that I may walk in the victorious life You secured for me.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.  First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.  The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.  Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.    As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.  In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.  We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.  Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Ephraim was given to him after he had been delivered from his suffering of 13 years. Joseph said that he named him this because God had made him fruitful in the land of his suffering. Ephraim means "twice fruitful."  Joseph was fruitful in two instances. He was fruitful during his time of adversity and in his prosperity. When God brings us into a time of suffering, it can be a fruitful time. It's rare for us to see the fruit during the suffering period. But know that the roots are going deep into the spiritual soil of our soul because of our pressing in to God during our time of suffering. This is producing a work in our character that cannot be seen until it finishes the process. Such was the case for Joseph.  It was not until several years after such a time of suffering that I began to see the fruit of the trials that the Lord allowed me to experience. How grateful I am to understand some of the "why" that has led to a new life in Him that I would never have had without this period.  Samson had great anointing but lacked character. We see many today who have great anointing yet lack character. But God is raising up Josephs who not only have great anointing for these days but also great character. Suffering produces character.  If you find yourself in a time of suffering, now is the time to press into God. Let your roots grow deeper. Whenever there is a famine, tree roots are forced to drive deeper into the soil to find water. These times are designed to create such a deep-rooted faith that our natures will be changed forever.  * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * * * * * *  Want some practical ways to integrate your faith and work?

I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:  Week of Jan 14:  Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".  A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.  The Splash page will look something like the following:      A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"  Week of Jan. 21:  If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).  We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.  General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. 		  Trading/Origination Coordination  Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.   NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:  For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.

<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  Day 4 - October 18, 2001  Afternoon Session     Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices   Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.      General Observations      The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions.       FERC Deliverables   A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.    The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.  The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.  The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.    One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:   ·         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?   ·         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are allowed)?    ·         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?   ·         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?   ·         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?   ·         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?   ·         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?   ·         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?   Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financial hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.  Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.   NERC and GISB   A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.  Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.  Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.  There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.  The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Unlike our day-to-day emotions which are the product of our day-to-day thought life, emotional baggage from the past is always there. Years of exposure and experience in life have etched grooves in our memory banks which are triggered by current events.  For example, if your kind, loving grandfather was named Bill, you probably have a favorable emotional reaction to other people named Bill. But if the school bully was named Bill, your initial reaction to the Bills in your life is probably negative. If your spouse suggests, "Let's name our first child Bill," you might even react, "Over my dead body!"  I call these long-term emotions which lurk beneath the surface primary emotions. The intensity of your primary emotions is determined by your previous life history. The more traumatic your experience, the more intense will be your primary emotion. Many of these primary emotions will lie dormant and have very little effect on your life until something comes along to trigger them. Have you ever brought up a topic of conversation which upset someone and sent him storming out of the room? "What set him off?" you wondered. He was "set off" because a bad experience in his past was triggered by your topic. The trigger is any present event which he associates with the past conflict.  Most people try to control their primary emotions by avoiding the people or events which trigger them. But you can't isolate yourself completely from everything which may set off a response. You are bound to see something on TV or hear something in a conversation which will bring to mind your unpleasant experience. You must learn how to resolve previous conflicts or the emotional baggage will accumulate and the past will control your life.  During the next few days, we will consider ways to resolve our emotional baggage from the past.  Lord, I don't want to be controlled by past events. Show me how I can resolve these issues so I can walk in freedom today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

One of the greatest personal crises I have faced in the ministry revolved around the issue of forgiveness and a board member. I struggled relating to this man, and I knew that I couldn't continue on the way things were. So I decided to resign my pastorate.  The week before I was going to read my resignation to the congregation, I got sick. I was flat on my back with a temperature of 103.5 and I totally lost my voice. It was easy to recognize that God wasn't pleased with my decision. I began reading the Gospels and came upon Mark 8:22-26 where Jesus healed the blind man. I noticed that after Jesus' first touch, the man said, "I see men . . . like trees" (verse 24). I suddenly realized that I saw this man like that: a big tree, an obstacle blocking my path.  Then Jesus touched the blind man again and he began to see people clearly, not as trees. I got the message. "Lord, I don't love this man. I know You do, and I want to. But You will have to touch me like You did that blind man. Lord, I need You to touch me so I can be the person You want me to be." And God did! I chose at that moment to forgive the man completely.  The next Sunday I went to church, not to resign, but to preach. My voice was still so husky that I almost couldn't speak. I confessed to the congregation my own independence and my desire for the Lord to touch me, to see people as people, not as obstacles to my goals. At the end of the sermon, I invited anyone who desired a touch from the Lord to join me at the altar. Soon the altar area and the aisles in the front were packed with people. Eventually all but a few people had come forward. It was a revival!  Guess who was one of the few? To my knowledge he never changed, but I did. And I thank God to this day that He put me flat on my back to make me the pastor He wanted me to be. If I had had my way, I would probably be out of the ministry today.  Lord, touch me today that I may love the difficult people in my life as You do.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

I have found that many Christians struggle with the distinction between temptation and sin. Bombarded by tempting thoughts, they conclude that there must be something pretty sick about them. But even Jesus was "tempted in all things as we are." But finish the verse: "Yet without sin." As long as we are in the world, we are exposed to temptation just like Jesus was. But He didn't sin, and we don't have to sin either (1 Corinthians 10:13).  The basis for temptation is legitimate human needs. We will either look to the world, the flesh and the devil to have our needs met, or we will look to Christ who promises to meet our needs (Philippians 4:19). The essence of temptation is the invitation to live independently of God.  The power of temptation depends on the strength of the strongholds which have been developed in our minds as we learned to live independently of God. If you were raised in a Christian home where magazines and television programs of questionable moral value were not allowed, the power of sexual temptation in your life will not be as great as for someone who grew up exposed to pornographic materials. Why? Because your legitimate need to be loved and accepted was met by parents who also protected you from exposure to illegitimate means of meeting your needs. The person who grew up in an environment of immorality may experience a greater struggle with sexual temptation simply because that stronghold in the mind was well-established before he was born again.  Jesus was tempted to meet His own physical needs by using His divine attributes independently of the Father to turn a rock into bread. But instead He responded, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). We also must respond to temptation by relying on God to meet our needs.

TJ and Claudette -- please send to your groups.  Thanks   -----Original Message----- From: 	Landwehr, Susan M.   Sent:	Thursday, October 18, 2001 6:19 PM  Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners   This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts.   Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.  Here's some individual comments:  Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.  Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.  Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.    Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were.   Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.  Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.    Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.  Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.  Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.   From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."   Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.

Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 06:00:00 +0200 (CEST) From: Crosswalk.com <marketplace@lists.crosswalk.com> To: jeff.king@enron.com Subject: TGIF Marketplace Meditation -- The Door of Full Surrender X-SDOC: 940828 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-404.eml  T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T Marketplace Meditations by Os Hillman  The Door of Full Surrender  But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold. - (Job 23:10)   I was recently sitting with the leader of a marketplace organization as he described a question he poses to businesspeople. "What if there were two doors to choose from; behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and behind the other door was how life could be according to your own preference. Which door would you choose?" The struggle for most lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.  If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and personal.  If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others. Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a greater degree than through another. The events of your life would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through you.  Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward of your inheritance. "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (2 Cor. 4:17).     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

I am a PhD student at Iowa State University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.  Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.  I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.  Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email.     1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.    2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques.    2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd.    3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of this.    4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.    5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta.    6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS future v5.0    7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training engine (not yet released)    8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods.  This is the situation:     I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price.     Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).  This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.  John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd, Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.  Ok.  Here are the possibilities.     1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading forecasting technology    2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about    3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself    4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims.   I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts.  Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem.  What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will show you flaws in other "gems".  I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.  Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.  Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation. Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available. Start and end with a flat position Make markets in your respective products Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage  NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.  Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.  Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").  Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation.   The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE LOME- TOGO. TEL:00228-911-40-37.    DEAR,                    (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)  I am Dr OLOGURU, chief accountant for the bills and credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of Union Togolaise Du Banque Lome-Togo in west Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.  During our investigation and auditting in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on november 1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.  Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six million five hundred thousand united states dollars).  As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friends who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem .  Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.  I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while 60% will be for me and my partner.  Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account. and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentage.  previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.  Yours faithfully, Dr.OLOGURU TEL:00228-911-40-37.     __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Great stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!

·	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.    ·	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday. o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees  ·	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.  ·	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.   o	Red - Move Team o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT o	Green - Telephony  ·	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).  ·	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.    ·	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.  ·	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.  .	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.    ·	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building  I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.  PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.  Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

Where do mediums and spiritists get their "amazing" information and insights? Many of them are demonic channelers, but much of what is called "spiritism" and "psychic phenomena" is no more than clever illusion. hese so-called spiritists give what is referred to as "cold readings." You go to them for advice or direction, and they ask you a few simple, leading questions. Based on the information you give, they make general observations which are probably true of most people in your situation. But you're so impressed with the accuracy of their "revelations" that you start tipping them off to all kinds of details which they can fabricate into their "reading." This is not demonic; it's just mental and verbal sleight-of-hand.  But the mediums and spiritists that God warned against in Leviticus and Deuteronomy were not con artists, but people who possessed and passed on knowledge which didn't come through natural channels of perception. These people have opened themselves up to the spirit world and have become channels of knowledge from Satan. The charlatan with his phony cold readings is only interested in bilking you of your money. But the false knowledge and direction which comes from Satan through a medium is intended to bilk you of your spiritual vitality and freedom.  There's big money in psychic/con artist operations, and a lot of magicians are raking it in. Many people crave to know something extra about their lives and their future, and they will pay handsomely if they think you can give them the inside information they desire.  When a psychic claims to have contacted the dead, don't believe it. When a psychologist claims to have regressed a client back to a former existence through hypnosis, don't believe it. When a New Age medium purports to channel a person from the past into the present, realize that it is nothing more than a familiar spirit or the fraudulent work of a con artist.  Lord Jesus, You are the way, the truth and the life. I renounce any power or revelation from any other source than You.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

We are all here!" - (Acts 16:28)   Paul and Silas had just been thrown into prison. An earthquake erupted and the jail cell was opened. It's Paul and Silas' opportunity. "Deliverance! Praise God!" might be the appropriate response. But this is not what Paul and Silas did. In fact, rather than leave, they sat quietly in their cell area. The guard, in fear of his life, knew that it would be automatic death if prisoners escaped. Paul and Silas did not leave because they saw a higher purpose for which they were in prison. They were not looking at their circumstance; they were much more concerned about the unsaved guard. The story goes on to explain how Paul and Silas went home with the guard and his family. Not only did the guard get saved, but his entire household as well.  What a lesson this is for us. How often we are so busy looking for deliverance from our circumstance that we miss God completely. God is looking to do miracles in our circumstances if we will only look for them. Sometimes as businesspeople we become so obsessed with our goals we miss the process that God involves us in, which may be where the miracle lies. What if that bill collector who has been hounding you is unsaved and he is there for you to speak to? What if a problem account has arisen due to something God is doing beyond what you might see at this time? Our adverse situations can often be the door of spiritual opportunity for those who need it.  I saw this personally when God allowed me to go through a number of adversities. It took some time, but I saw some great miracles as a result of those adversities. When God said that "all things work together for good for those who are called according to His purposes" (see Rom. 8:28), He meant all things. It is up to us to find the "work together for good" part by being faithful to the process. In the next adversity you face, tune your spiritual antennae and ask God for discernment to see the real purpose for the adversity.

These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below  Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.   Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00 Exclusion amount			$  65.00  Taxable Income amount		$  35.00  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Date: Fri, 4 Jan 2002 16:35:14 +0100 (CET) Subject: FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening From: Enron General Announcements <mbx_anncenron@ENRON.com> To: DL-GA-all_enron_houston_employees <DL-GA-all_enron_houston_employees@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 57597 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-149.eml  Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.) The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:    	     The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time.  Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.   Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002. Your continued support is greatly appreciated.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60 cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1 reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 - $6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The whole transaction took less than a year.   TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP  PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.  The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites certain caveats including that ``...these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by TSYI....''  The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In conclusion, the process and its potential application to utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''  Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization, including those mentioned in this report. But, we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''  Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is presently a development-stage company. It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state, using air as the medium of movement. This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials. Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry-process technology. This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures, including: drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction, Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation, agriculture, mining, environment, construction, ceramics, and materials transportation. We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years, if adopted for implementation in several large projects. Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18 million shares currently outstanding.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.  To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.  The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.  I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.  During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.  Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   "Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Os Hillman, president of Marketplace Leaders, located in Atlanta, GA.

Simply let your "Yes" be "Yes," and your "No," "No"; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. - (Matthew 5:36-37)   Imagine for a moment that you are living in Jesus' time. It is before Jesus has begun His public ministry. He is a carpenter in your local town of Nazareth. You have asked Jesus to make a table for you. You're on a deadline and you must have it in a week. You agree on the price of for the table and the date of one week for completion. A week later you arrive to pick up the table. You lay your money down on the table and Jesus says, "Mr. Johnson, I am sorry but the table is not ready. I ran into complications. Also, I can no longer honor the price I gave you. It is now instead of ."  Two years later you hear about this same Jesus who is preaching to the local townspeople. How are you going to view this Jesus? You probably won't give much credence to His message because of your personal experience. Our lives have an ability to reinforce the message we stand for, or they can violate it and make it totally ineffective. This literally happens all over the world in different settings with Christian businesspeople. Our message becomes ineffective because we have not done what we said.  I know people who, when they tell me they plan to do something, I can expect them to follow through about 50 percent of the time. I am sure you have had the same experience. Words and commitments are made with little meaning behind those words. However, I know others who will follow through almost every time. The only time they don't is when something falls outside their control. I quickly learn whose words have substance behind them.  There are times when we are unable to perform or deliver what we promised due to outside influences. The key to turning these potentially negative circumstances into a witness for Christ is communication. If we are unable to pay a bill on time, we must communicate with those we owe and make a good faith effort to resolve it within our means. In these cases, God's purposes are being performed as well if we seek to do the right thing.  Do your words mean anything to those who hear them? Do you make commitments and fail to follow through on them? What would others say about how you follow through? Ask the Lord today to show you how you are doing in this area. You might even want to ask three people who are the closest to you how you fare in this area.  * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * * * * * *  How do you develop plans?

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.  Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.

A few years ago, caught up in the excitement and  anticipation of competitive markets, utilities scrambled to broaden their  earnings horizons beyond the simple rate of return they had been receiving  in the past. The search for new business lines often lead to new trading  businesses and branching into the telecommunications industry. Now that  we have seen trading exhaust its 15 minutes of fame, 2002 may bring the  reconciling of utilities’ telecom business segments. Many telecom units  remain hidden from plain view; in this article for illustrative purposes, we  examine the future prospects and impact that recently spun-off Williams  Communications (WCG) may have on Williams (WMB) shareholders as it  struggles to survive. We felt this issue was particularly timely given the  debate that surrounds this subject, which seems to weigh on Williams’ stock,  seemingly discounting it.  Markets  Investors remained skittish and on their toes this week as the market saw a  volatile week close sharply down due to uncertain earnings announcements,  more fallout from Enron, and K-mart’s potential bankruptcy filing. The  markets continued last week’s slide, as the Nasdaq and Dow declined 4.5%  and 1.7% this week, respectively. RWR’s Power Technology stocks also  closed sharply down as losers beat winners by more than two to one. Stuart  Energy, a developer of hydrogen production units via electrolysis of water,  was the only DG related company with positive returns. In fact, without  news or fundamental changes, Stuart Energy was this week’s winner with a  return of 19.8%. Solar generation companies were the only sector to move  up in unison. Solarworld led the charge as it gained 10.1% after the company  announced a 118% increase in annual sales and a proposal to increase  dividends. NewPower’s close ties to its fraudulent founder and largest  shareholder, Enron, was the key factor leading to the company’s status as  this week’s loser as its stock decreased 33.3%. Also notable this week was  FuelCell Energy’s performance after an unfortunate incident at its Torrington,  Connecticut factory, in which a tape casting machine exploded. The explosion  did not lead to any structural damages but its stock declined 20.9% for the  week.  News Highlights for the Week                  ?

A few years ago, caught up in the excitement and  anticipation of competitive markets, utilities scrambled to broaden their  earnings horizons beyond the simple rate of return they had been receiving  in the past. The search for new business lines often lead to new trading  businesses and branching into the telecommunications industry. Now that  we have seen trading exhaust its 15 minutes of fame, 2002 may bring the  reconciling of utilities’ telecom business segments. Many telecom units  remain hidden from plain view; in this article for illustrative purposes, we  examine the future prospects and impact that recently spun-off Williams  Communications Group (WCG) may have on Williams (WMB) shareholders  as it struggles to survive. We felt this issue was particularly timely given the  debate that surrounds this subject, which seems to weigh on WMB’s stock,  seemingly discounting it.  The onset of deregulation sent utilities clamoring for new services that  would ensure customer retention and new revenue streams. The most  common of these new businesses was telecommunications. This was a  counter-intuitive move by deregulation-fearing utilities, as telecom  deregulation was relatively mature and market segments were highly  competitive on technological, customer service, and pricing basis—all areas  of expertise that most utility companies lacked. Additionally, utilities starting  or acquiring these businesses had to compete with large incumbent players  whose costs were largely fully amortized and who had already slimmed  margins to the bone.  Telecommunications, which lead the bullish economic surge of the late  twentieth century, seemed like the perfect answer for a utility trying to change  its stogy image. Unfortunately for the majority of the utility industry entering  the telecom market in the late nineties, this proved to be too little too late.  Many incumbent long distance carries had been building their respective  fiber optic networks for nearly a decade. New entrants paid a heavy price in  playing catch up, laying tens of thousands of miles of fiber without the  customers or cash flow streams that could support the build out. Additionally,  as the century turned so did the image of the telecom industry. It had become  clear that the industry was approaching a glut in fiber capacity and that,  despite the attractiveness of the enabling technologies, long haul carry was  still an expensive business with slim margins.

The Butte,  Montana-based integrated electric utility has been providing gas and electricity  services to more than two-thirds of Montana for decades. In early in 2000,  MTP management announced a decision to divest its energy business  completely and switch its focus from power to telecommunication. The  resulting company, TouchAmerica, would do business as a national, highspeed,  broadband fiber-optic products and services transport provider. As  expected, the highly publicized transformation has been scrutinized  relentlessly. MTP stock has fallen like a rock since hitting its high of  US$63.688 in April 2000. Today, the company’s stock trades 91.5% lower,  at US$5.39. Clearly, the post-internet bubble world does not appreciate little  guys playing in the capital-intensive telecom transmission space.  Since the shine wore off telecoms, most energy companies have been  reluctant to reveal the status or financial condition of their telecom businesses.  In fact, what was once the calling card of a forward-thinking utility is now  the hidden black hole for cash that nobody wants to talk about. The energy  industry’s most recent balance sheet shakeout and resulting restructuring  seems to have provided a catalyst for many companies to try selling-off these  businesses. Recently, Houston-based El Paso (EP) announced that, in an  effort to strengthen its cash position, they would be selling-off non performing  assets. Some of what the company has earmarked to be sold are assets related  to El Paso’s network business, which most had forgotten even existed.  One energy company that took different route in dealing with its  telecommunications business is WMB. As many other players spent time  trying to disguise their telecom businesses, WMB, in very bold fashion, spun  the business off to shareholders into what is now the publicly traded and  highly scrutinized WCG. While others have had success hiding telecom unit  losses, WMB’s telecom business is out in the open and exposed to detailed  examination by the media, shareholders, and Wall Street.  Pessimism surrounding WCG’s struggling business has been pinpointed as  a major factor in the discounted P/E of big brother WMB; however, it is not  clear that the market truly understands the correlation. With regards to WMB’s  stock, the question remains: just how bad does it look for the Communications  Group, and what impact could a bad or worst case scenario have on the  WMB shareholders? There is no question that WCG’s performance has been  stifled by the economic downturn; however, after going through the analysis,  it seems that the spin-off and separation was a good move by WMB as the  Communications group appears to have a very bumpy road ahead, despite  what others may be saying.

Total revenues for WCG in the third quarter  of 2001 were up 42.3% over third quarter 2000. Leading the revenue growth  is the company’s Network division. Revenues in WCG’s Network unit, which  accounts for 91% of total revenues, grew by 52.1% from 3Q00 to 3Q01.  However, the Network division also accounted for 91% of both total cost of  sales and total segment losses. Despite strong growth in revenues, the unit  continues to lose money at an alarming rate. The Network segment’s loss  from operations grew by 312.8% over 3Q00, fully discounting revenue growth,  and then some.  WCG has indicated to investors that the company will be EBITDA positive  in 2002—we remain skeptical as the Group has made such promises before.  As far as EBITDA positive predictions go, WCG’s have been somewhat of a  moving target. That is, the Company has been readjusting EBITDA positive  target dates annually. If investors remember some of the Company’s first  debt offerings, crossing the threshold into positive EBITDA was expected in  both 2000 and 2001. In a prospectus filed October 27, 2000, WCG explained  why Moody’s revised WCG’s outlook downward, “…due to our intention to  increase our capital expenditure program and our expectation that we will  turn EBITDA positive in 2001, rather than 2000…” Giving the company  the benefit of the doubt, missing EBITDA-positive expectations likely had  more to do with unforeseen negative economic conditions and a poor business  model rather than a lack of execution. But for that very reason, we must  continue to be skeptical, as economic conditions are likely to remain dismal  for at least the first half of 2002. Even then, a slight pickup in the economy  may not have a material EBITDA impact on the Company , as the resurgence  is likely to initially be felt in consumer goods and manufacturing before  rippling through to the high technology long haul broadband communications  sector.  Even if WCG were to achieve positive EBITDA in 2002, it makes little  difference to the company’s core financial health due to the increasing  discrepancy between EBITDA and interest coverage. Despite the continuing  negative EBITDA, in reality, the EBITDA loss has been decreasing over  time. Even so, we remain concerned that interest expense has been growing  at a faster pace than EBITDA, which is not reflected in a simple EBITDA  calculation. Based on our 4Q01 estimates for WCG, over the past eight  quarters, EBITDA loss will have shrunk by slightly more than half while  interest expense will have grown by nearly 170%.  Even though WCG, in many ways, remains in the expansion stage of its  development, the Company continues to put capital to work inefficiently.  Based on 4Q01 estimates, WCG’s ROIC, since 1Q01, has gotten progressively  The Prometheus File  Page 5                                                           www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  2  3  4  5  6     1Q00     2Q00     3Q00     4Q00     1Q01     2Q01     3Q01    4Q01E                                                                        %  $0  $50  $100  $150  $200  $250  $300  $350     1Q00     2Q00     3Q00     4Q00     1Q01     2Q01     3Q01    4Q01E  Net Loss  Total Revenues  MM  -5  -4  -3  -2     1Q00     2Q00     3Q00     4Q00     1Q01     2Q01     3Q01    4Q01E  ROIC Graph  1Q00 - 4Q01E  Net Loss to Total Revenues  1Q00 - 4Q01E  Net Loss to PPE  1Q00 - 4Q01E  Source: Company & RWR  Source: Company & RWR  Source: Company & RWR  worse, from -2.41% to -4.31%, as the company has tried to expand its network  feverishly and seen very little return for its efforts. Additionally, as an illustration  of the Groups continual loss of efficiency, net loss to PPE ratio has grown  from 2.4% in 1Q00 to an estimated 5.5% for the 4Q01. The further WCG  expands its network, the closer it comes to financial paralysis, as inefficient  use of capital is likely to force the company to take losses on the sale of  assets just to raise additional operating capital down the road.  WCG sits in the middle of a dismal pack, as the entire sector has default  concerns. In terms of existence, market focus, and size, WCG’s clearest  comparables are Level3 Communications and Global Crossing, who also  happen to be competition in some geographic locations. All three young  telecoms have had considerable difficulty making money, and the market  has recognized this. During the last two years, the three stocks combined  have lost over US$130 billion in aggregate market value, as well as reduced  sector confidence to the point that any additional financing for continuing  operations from the capital markets would be minimal at best. Bermudabased  Global Crossing has walked a very thin line between solvency and  bankruptcy over the past few quarters, recently obtaining a waiver resolving  year-end bank covenant concerns.  Due to the WCG’s inefficient use of capital, growing interest expense, and  poor earnings outlook, default concerns are likely to peak over the next 12  months. On January 15, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) lowered its ratings on the  company’s debt and placed it on CreditWatch with negative implications.  The downgrade and CreditWatch placement reflect S&P’s concern that WCG  may not be capable of adequately funding its business plan beyond 2002.  Estimated cash and bank availability of only US$1.5 billion at the close of  2001 may not last long as it will be needed to fund operations and debt  service beyond 2002 since free cash flow does not appear to be on the horizon.  With debt service and capital expenditure expected to exceed US$1 billion  in 2002, WCG may find itself searching for sustenance.  With no clear turnaround in sight, we believe capital markets will be  unwilling to continue assuming risk on behalf of the struggling telecom  business. Currently, WCG bonds trade at an average of US$0.40 to the dollar,  indicative of the market’s extreme skepticism regarding the company’s ability  to avoid default. These conditions leave WCG with few options going  forward. The first and most obvious would be to try and appropriate additional  funding from big brother WMB. Our sense is that any such funding would  be minimal and as stated before, we see WCG being forced into the sale of  assets at a loss or seeking chapter 11 protection.  The question remains: if a worst case scenario were to play out over the  next 12 to 18 months, how would it affect WMB? Due to WMB’s limited  Page 6                                                        The Prometheus File  www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  20  40  60  80  100  12/6/2000       2/25/2001       5/17/2001       8/6/2001      10/26/2001     1/15/2002  WCG Bond Price  December 1, 2000 - January 18, 2002  (CUSIP: 969455A47)  Source: BLP  equity ownership of WCG, negative implications would be to the tune of  US$2.6 billion from receivables, loan guarantees, lease payments, and a 3  year US$1.4 billion note. Through cash payments and the sale of equity it  appears the earnings exposure would only be about US$0.30 per share, or  roughly 10% of 2003 estimates, bringing estimated 2003 EPS to US$2.65.  Although the exposure appears minimal, we believe that WMB stock is  trading within an acceptable range, and does not yet appear to be discounted.  Due to the material risk of insolvency by WCG, at this point, we will fully  account for the effects, reducing our estimated 2003 EPS to US$2.65. At the  reduced EPS figure, WMB’s current price to 2003 earnings premium is 9.18  times, which is very close to that of WMB’s nearest comparable, EP, with its  estimated 2003 P/E of 9.90. For this reason, we remain positive on WMB  stock in the long-term. However, contrary to what other analysts are saying,  we do not feel that WMB presents a buying opportunity in the near-term, as  US$26.50, compared to the current US$24 price range, would be our topend  price target for the next two quarters. On the other hand, if WCG begins  to turn around in 2002, and their perceived risk of bankruptcy diminishes, at  that point, we would reevaluate our short-term position on WMB. Finally,  we would like reiterate our long-term positive position on Williams (WMB)  stock based on coming growth and volatility in the natural gas and power  markets and we urge investors looking to maximize returns to accumulate  and hold WMB stock for the long haul, weathering whatever storm WCG  may bring on.

The contract gained US$0.046 and  US$0.041 on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.  According to the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission, as of January 8, traders had sold 47,104 more  contracts than they had bought, marking the largest such  short position on record. Going into Wednesday, traders  and analyst surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting a gas  storage withdrawal of 122Bcf, significantly lower than the  previous week’s 190Bcf withdrawal.  Morning action on Wednesday was dominated by storage  related selling; however, the tables quickly turned when  the AGA announced that for the week ended January 11,  U.S. natural gas inventories were depleted by 137Bcf, bring  the total storage level to 2,529Bcf. In afternoon action,  the February contract gained US$0.103 to settle at  US$2.394/MMBtu, followed by the March contract, which  climbed US$0.09 cents to US$2.363. As we expect with  most rallies, the reality of continuing gas supply strength  came into play Thursday, as the February contract fell  US$0.14 or 5.9% to US$2.254/MMBtu. Despite last  week’s larger than expected withdrawal, storage levels are  still 1,070Bcf higher than they were during the same period  one year ago. Again, we continue to reiterate our overall  position that any rallies in the February contract will likely  continue to be short-lived, as warm winter weather and  low demand are expected to continue.

On the first day of  trading, only 276/MWh was transacted representing a total  of US$3,800. However, despite its slow start, one week  later over 2,438/MWh was traded on the exchange. Part  of the reason volumes have been light is a result of the  Czech government’s liberalization ruling, which limits the  amount of large industrial corporations that are qualified  to participate to companies with annual electricity  consumption of over 4/GWh. Trading at the new exchange  currently comprises only 1% of daily electricity  consumption in Czechoslovakia.  Keppel Subsidiaries Receives Electricity Contract  Keppel’s oil and electricity power subsidiary announced  that the company had won a US$400 million contract to  supply electricity to Commercializadore Brasileira de  Energia Emergencial in Northeastern Brazil. The new  contract allows Keppel Fels Energy and Infrastructure to  build a power plant at the port of Aratu. The company  will begin supplying electricity from June 2002 to the end  of 2004.                                           Calpine Cuts FY02 Estimates, Reduces Capital  Spending  On January 16, Calpine announced it would put US$2  billion worth of power projects on hold. The company  revised earnings downward for FY01 and FY02 to  US$1.95/share and US$1.70/share, from US$2.00/share  and US$2.20/share, respectively. The earnings reduction  was the result of an equity dilution and the company’s  poor performance as power prices have dropped in the  U.S. recession. Calpine will complete the 27 power plants  that are currently under construction, which represents  15,200MW of new capacity. By the end of 2003, the  company will have a total generating capacity of  26,300MW. Due to recent events, the company will delay  34 projects and place them in a group called “hot standbys”.  Calpine will begin construction on projects in the  hot stand-by group once capital is available at attractive  rates. The company says it will not be penalized for  delaying turbine orders as its contract has a fixed and  flexible portion. Flexible orders are being delayed until  the market improves and demand for power increases.  During the call, Calpine did state that spark spreads have  significantly reduced to an average of US$6/MWh, down  from the company’s targeted US$15 to US$18/MWh.  However, with the reduced capital expense, Calpine  projects it will have sufficient cash to cover expenses  through the end of the year and moving forward the  Utiliity Service Providers (USP)  The Prometheus File  Page 9                                                           www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  company expects a significant increase in cash flow due  to the large amount of new capacity coming on line.  Calpine’s announcement was viewed favorably as the  company’s shares closed up 7.8% on January 16. Most  investors had already priced in a reduction of earnings  and expected the company to reduce its expansion plans.  We are optimistic about Calpine’s hot stand-by group,  which allows the company to put projects on hold rather  than selling assets. On the call, Calpine said there is  currently around 118,000MW of capacity for sale in the  U.S. With such a large amount of capacity for sale,  companies will likely have to sell at a discount to find  buyers. Looking forward, Calpine is prepared to  outperform market expectations and will likely see strong  growth if the U.S. economy rebounds and weather patterns  return to normal. We strongly favor Calpine as we believe  the company’s fundamentals are still strong and the stock  is extremely cheap on a valuation basis.  Calpine Files with SEC to Raise US$871.4 Million  Calpine filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) to sell securities to raise up to  US$871.4 million over time for plant construction and  other general needs. Under the filing, Calpine requested  permission to sell debt, common or preferred stock, or  new securities whenever it needs. The US$871.4 million  security offering would be in addition to the US$1.6 billion  unsold by Calpine from previous registrations, giving the  company US$2.5 billion total on the shelf. In its SEC  filing, the company may decide to raise money by selling  preferred securities through a subsidiary trust, which would  use the funds to buy debt from the parent company on the  same terms. Bloomberg reported that this would allow  Calpine to increase equity capital by issuing preferred stock  while getting a tax deduction for payments on the debt.  ChevronTexaco Purchases Additional Dynegy  Shares  Dynegy announced that ChevronTexaco will exercise its  right to retain its 26.5% stake in the company through the  purchase of 10.4 million shares of Class B common stock.  Net proceeds from the sale will total US$205 million,  which will be used for general corporate purposes,  including debt reduction. Under an existing shareholder’s  agreement, ChevronTexaco has the right to purchase    additional common shares when new stock is issued.  Dynegy sold US$568 million of Class A common stock in  December as part of the company’s restructuring plan. As  a result of the announcement, the company adjusted FY02  earnings to US$2.26/share from US$2.30/share. The  agreement further demonstrates ChevronTexaco’s  commitment to Dynegy. The additional cash will also allow  Dynegy to continue to reduce its debt to capitalization  ratio and maintain strong reserves for its trading  operations, which could eventually lead to an upgrade of  the company’s credit ratings.  Dynegy, AES Pulls Out of SpA Bid  Dynegy and AES said they have pulled out of bidding  for SpA, which is being sold by Italy’s Enel. Reportedly,  both companies refused to give a bank guarantee of US$88  million to Enel. The remaining bidders include four  European groups, which are expected to submit bids by  the end of February. Mirant pulled out of the bidding last  month as part of its restructuring plan to reduce expansion  both in the U.S. and abroad. The move comes as U.S.  power generators are cutting expansion plans around the  world in an effort to regain and maintain investment grade  credit ratings.  AES NewEnergy Gets Oregon Approval, Renews  Marriott Contract  AES NewEnergy announced it has received its  certification as a scheduling Electricity Service Supplier  (ESS) from the Public Utility Commission of Oregon. The  company can now begin selling power to businesses that  are currently being served by Oregon’s two largest utilities,  Portland General Electric and PacifiCorp. AES  NewEnergy also announced that Marriott renewed their  supply contract, which allows the company to supply  power to seven Marriott hotels in New York City and  Westchester County. We expect AES NewEnergy will  quickly take a leading role in Oregon’s power market, just  as it has in Ohio, New York, and several other states in  the U.S., which have partially deregulated power markets.  The company’s ability to provide significant savings to  customers is winning contracts throughout the nation. We  expect AES NewEnergy to maintain its current leading  Page 10                                                       The Prometheus File  www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  position, as additional states move forward with plans to  deregulate their power markets. However, this does not  change our HOLD recommendation on AES as economic  conditions in Latin America remain poor.  Enron Could Take Additional US$1.3 Billion Hit  The New York Times reported that a letter sent to Ken  Lay in August from Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron  employee, suggests that the company might have to further  reduce past earnings by US$1.3 billion. In the letter,  Watkins discusses another partnership called Condor. The  partnership was financed with Enron stock and made  investments that generated US$800 million in cash.  Experts say that the US$800 million might need to be  deducted from earnings. In addition, the letter also says  that another partnership, Raptor, generated US$500 million  in revenue, which might also have to be written off.  Separately, Arthur Andersen remains under intense scrutiny  as the auditing firm received several warnings regarding  Enron’s financial practices. Andersen reportedly  considered dropping Enron as a client last year, but did  not do so. On January 15, David Duncan, the lead partner  on the Enron account, testified before several  Congressional committees stating that he ordered the  destruction of Enron documents while the company was  being investigated by the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Breaking Enron News – Company Fires Arthur  Andersen  In a completely unsurprising move, Enron officially  announced it fired Arthur Andersen as its accountant after  a congressional subcommittee released that Andersen had  questions about Enron’s finances almost a year ago. Ken  Lay stated, “The Company could not wait any longer in  light of recent events.” Andersen also recently admitted  to destroying documents about Enron’s finances. We are  relieved that Enron, and more importantly Ken Lay, have  finally seen the light and cut Andersen loose for bringing  the company down. We were wondering what it would  take for Enron to fire its accountant after they admitted to  shredding documents only two days prior.                TXU Completes Sale of UK Distribution Assets  TXU announced that the sale of its U.K. distribution  business and its 50% interest in 24seven to London  Electricity Group was completed. TXU originally  announced the sale in November 2001 for GBP1.31 billion,  or US$1.87 billion. Through the sale of the U.K.  distribution business, TXU intends to enhance  management focus on the merchant energy business and  improve growth prospects in Europe. It also reduces debt  levels and improves interest coverage through GBP1.3  billion of debt reduction, which will result in strengthening  its balance sheet. Through the U.K. asset sales and  generation plants in Texas, TXU achieved management’s  US$2 billion targeted asset sales. With completion of these  asset sales, we expect TXU will achieve its goal of a 55%  net debt to capital ratio by mid-2002.  TXU Idles UK Plants as Power Prices Tumble  TXU announced that the company will idle two coal-fired  plants generating 522MW of electricity due to lower  wholesale power prices in the U.K. TXU will mothball  the plants until market conditions improve. The New  Electricity Trading Arrangements, which came in effect  last March, resulted in an oversupply of generation and  lowered power prices by 25%. TXU has over 5.3 million  retail customers with 3,000MW of physical generating  capacity and 6,300MW of contracted generation in the  U.K. TXU is the largest natural gas trader and the second  largest electricity trader in the U.K. In our view, idling  522MW capacity will have no significant impact on overall  European operations, though thinning margins in the U.K.  has been a concern. However, we continue to believe  TXU’s merchant energy business model, which consists of  generation, trading, and retail supply, is a competitive  advantage to its peers.  TXU Expands Renewable Operations in Spain  TXU said it will invest roughly US$10 million to buy a  40% stake in two wind farms in central Spain. The  company expects the first wind farm to begin operations  U.S. Utilities  The Prometheus File  Page 11                                                          www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  by the end of 2002. TXU has been trying to expand its  operations in Spain for several years. This renewable  energy project is consistent with TXU’s strategic plans to  grow in the Iberian region.  AEP’s US$10 Billion Acquisition Questioned by  Judges  A federal appeal court challenged AEP’s US$10 billion  acquisition of Central & South West in 2000. The appeals  court petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission  to reconsider its approval of the purchase. The case  questions whether the acquisition meets the Public Utility  Holding Company Act requirements that utility networks  be physically interconnected and confined to a single area  or region. As a result of the acquisition, AEP grew its  operations from Virginia to Texas, with almost 5 million  customers in 11 states. AEP remains confident that  interconnectivity can be sufficiently demonstrated to meet  the requirements of the act. With its 38,000MW of  generation capacity, growing presence in the wholesale  market, and attractive dividend yields, we continue to  believe AEP will provide justifiable total returns and  potential growth in power trading and marketing after the  demise of Enron.  EDF Restructures Regional Division  Electricite de France, Europe’s largest power company,  will reorganize its business into geographic divisions to  reduce costs after a string of acquisitions in the last couple  of years. EDF serves 20 million customers abroad and 31  million household customers in France. The company has  made more than two dozen acquisitions since 1992. With  Europe’s electricity market becoming increasingly  competitive, EDF intends to decentralize its structure to  focus more on each of the different regions. The company  hopes to lower operating costs by decentralization.  Duke to Build New Power Plants in West  Duke/Fluor Daniel, a venture of Duke Energy, and  construction company Fluor plans to build three natural  gas-fueled power plants valued at US$1.2 billion to  increase Duke’s generating capacity in the West. The  company indicated that a 1,200MW plant and a 620MW  plant will be constructed in Nevada and Washington.  These plants are scheduled to start operations by 3Q03.     Progress Energy Invests in Natural Gas  Progress Energy agreed to invest US$153 million for  natural gas assets in Texas and Louisiana to obtain a supply  of fuel for its power plants and gas customers. Progress  will pay Westchester Gas US$135 million in stock and  US$18 million in cash for the assets. Westchester Gas  Company is a privately held natural gas company located  in Jonesville, Texas. Progress Ventures participates in the  wholesale energy business through fuel extraction,  manufacturing and delivery; merchant generation; and  energy marketing and trading. The parties intend to  negotiate a definitive agreement and complete due  diligence in 1Q02. The investment is expected to be  accretive to Progress Energy’s earnings in FY02 and  expected to be completed in 1Q02, if regulatory approval  is obtained.  Reliant Settles with Shareholders of Dutch Unit  Reliant Energy announced that the company’s Dutch unit,  Reliant Energy Power Generation Benelux and its former  shareholders reached a settlement resolving their stranded  cost obligations related to its acquisition of the unit. Under  the settlement, shareholders will pay Reliant US$165  million this month and another US$35 million in February.  Reliant estimates a net gain of US$35 million. Reliant  acquired the unit from the Dutch government in 1999.  Acumentrics and NiSource Sign Agreement  Acumentrics and Nisource announced they have signed  stock purchase, distribution, and product purchase  agreements. Nisource Energy, a subsidiary of Nisource,  has agreed to acquire a 3% stake in Acumentrics. The  purchase and distribution agreement signed by the  companies provides that Nisource will purchase up to  US$10 million of Acumentrics’ proprietary fuel cell  products. Under the agreement, Nisource Energy is  granted exclusive rights to distribute the products in the  Mid-Atlantic and Midwest markets. The purchase and  distribution agreement will begin after Acumentrics’ fuel  cells reach commercialization and last for five years  Distributed Generation  Page 12                                                       The Prometheus File  www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  thereafter. Acumentrics is a private company that produces  natural gas fueled solid-oxide fuel cells for commercial  and residential applications. The agreement will add  Nisource to the company’s current alliance partners which  include ChevronTexaco, Northeast Utilities, and General  Dynamics. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are solid-state fuel cells  that utilize a ceramic electrolyte. These cells operate at  the highest temperature range for fuel cells, approximately  1000 degrees Celsius, making it a good candidate for  residential and commercial cogeneration applications. In  addition, solid oxide fuel cells that utilize natural gas have  the highest energy conversion efficiency.  Plug Announces Milestones Achieved in 2001  Plug Power announced 4Q01 and FY01 accomplishments  and milestones achieved prior to its earnings  announcement on February 26. During 2001, the company  delivered 132 systems, which included 131 5kW systems  that operate on natural gas and one 50kW prototype system  that operates on hydrogen. Plug delivered 81 fuel cell  systems during 4Q, which includes 50 systems to the Long  Island Power Authority (LIPA) and 20 systems to the New  York State Energy Research and Development Authority  (NYSERDA). The LIPA delivery completed a contract  for 75 fuel cell systems and the NYSERDA delivery was  the last of 44 systems ordered. Other accomplishments  included Plug’s ability to reduce the direct material cost  of its stationary unit by 37%, which was realized through  changes in the system design and improved supply chain  management. Plug’s ability to meet delivery dates and  cost reduction goals is commendable. Moving forward,  we believe the company needs to secure additional orders  such as the LIPA and NYSERDA contracts in order to see  significant cost reductions.  Hydrogenics Added to Canada’s TSE 300 Index  Hydrogenics said the company has been selected by  Standard & Poor (S&P) to be added to Canada’s TSE 300  Composite Index. The change was effective on Friday,  January 18. The TSE 300 Composite Index comprises  approximately 71% of market capitalization for Canadianbased,  Toronto Stock Exchange listed companies.  Hydrogenics has strongly benefited from its strategic  partnership with General Motors, formed in October 2001.    The company’s stock has increased 187%, from US$2.57/  share on October 16 to US$7.39/share as of January 18.  Sweden’s Green Certificates Jeopardize Wind  Power  The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA)  strongly objected to the Swedish government’s plan to  implement a green certificate program in the country. A  government report released in 2001 suggests replacing the  green certificate program with the existing investment and  operational support for renewable energy. The report  predicts that most new renewable energy capacity will  come from biomass at the expense of wind generated  energy. The proposed system will require retailers to  purchase 15.3% of renewable energy from qualifying  renewable generators by 2010. Wind energy production  is currently supported by an incentive of SEK320/MWh  (US$30.50/kWh), whereas the green certificate system will  reduce the incentive to SEK60/MWh (US$5.72/kWh).  Wind energy development in Sweden has been minimal in  comparison with neighboring countries, due to the  country’s low electricity prices from hydroelectric and  nuclear power plants. If the government approves the  green certificate program, it will likely stop the progress  of wind energy development in the country unless  additional incentives for wind energy are implemented,  or until off-shore wind farms become commercially viable.  New Off-shore Wind Farm Proposed in Denmark  The Danish government’s Project Bureau for CO2  Reductions will be receiving bids for a proposed 100MW  off-shore wind farm. A number of firms, including Vestas,  E.On, Shell, Siemens, and Electrabel, have shown interest  in the off-shore wind farm. Announcement of the winner  is scheduled for mid-April and the construction is expected  to start in 2003. The proposed project will be the second  largest off-shore wind farm in Denmark, following the  160MW Horns Rev off-shore wind farm. While the wind  industry’s growth for 2002-2003 will depend on the U.S.  Renewables   The Prometheus File  Page 13                                                          www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  government’s decision to extend the wind production tax  incentive, other European markets have continued to  actively increase wind energy capacity.  NEG Micon Receives Orders for Greece  NEG Micon received orders from two Greek companies  for wind turbines. Wind Parks of Thrace and International  Wind Parks of Thrace will use NEG Micon’s NM52/900  wind turbines for the construction of wind farms in the  northern part of Greece in 2002. The cost of the 51 wind  turbine orders is estimated to be Dkk250 million. NEG  Micon’s exposure to the U.S. market is expected to be  minimal in 2002, as management has stated previously  that they will not build a manufacturing plant in the U.S.  unless the production tax credit is extended for at least  two years. However, in order to regain its leading position,  NEG Micon will need to prepare for its expansion in the  U.S. market or strengthen its position in other high-growth  high-capacity markets, such as France, U.K., and Italy.  Spire Installs 100kW of PV Systems in Chicago  Spire Solar Chicago announced that it has installed a total  of 100kW of photovoltaic (PV) systems during 4Q01 on  the roofs of Chicago’s buildings. The PV systems were  installed with the cooperation of the City of Chicago,  ComEd, BP Solar, and the Illinois Department of  Commerce and Community Affair, on museums, public  schools, small business buildings, and ComEd’s Hydome  facility, as part of the city’s project to produce clean energy  in Chicago. The company plans to install additional PV  systems in 911 Emergency Communications Centers and  Spire Solar Chicago’s future homes. Spire’s continued  cooperation with the City of Chicago is significant because  of the potential size of the deal and overall, it is likely to  draw significant attention to solar energy.  ENDESA to Install Additional 500MW of Wind  Capacity  ENDESA Cogeneracion y Renovables announced it was  awarded a contract to install 500MW of wind capacity in  Spain by Valencian State authorities. Under the agreement,  ENDESA will develop the installed capacity in three areas  with an estimated investment of EUR500 million. MADE,  a fully owned ENDESA subsidiary, will be the company  in charge of building the aerogenerators that will be    installed in the wind farms. ENDESA Cogeneracion y  Renovables currently operates more than 1,600MW of  wind capacity.  BP, ChevronTexaco to Build 22.5MW Wind Farm  BP and ChevronTexaco reported they will build a  22.5MW wind farm at their jointly owned Nerefco oil  refinery near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The US$23  million project is expected to begin operations in 2H02  and will be the first substantial use of wind turbine  technology for both BP and ChevronTexaco. Electricity  from the wind farm will also be sold locally and support  the Dutch national target for renewable energy.  Russian Aluminium Part of Brazilian Power  Transmission Project  The Industrial Association of Brazil, Santa Katarina State,  the Brazilian corporations, Luminar and ITS, and Russian  Aluminium signed a Memorandum of Intent to produce  aluminum cable for the Brazilian electric grid. General  Electric, ITS’s parent company, confirmed its interest to  cooperate with Russian Aluminum to implement Brazil’s  current 10-year development plan for its electrical  transmission. Russian Aluminium is the second largest  aluminum producer in the world and accounts for a total  of 70% of Russian primary aluminum output. The  company has long standing trade relations with Brazil.  India’s Transmission Sector Expects New Joint  Venture  PowerGrid Corporation of India (PGCIL) announced a  joint venture agreement with Tapa Power for the Tapa HEP  project. The agreement was formed in order to encourage  private participation in the country’s transmission sector.  It is estimated that PGCIL will have a 49% stake and Tapa  Power will retain a 51% stake with management control  in the deals with an estimated US$284.40million.

The 62-mile line will run  from a Tucson Electric Power substation at Sahuarita to  Citizens’ service territory in Santa Cruz County.  Construction for the US$70 million, 345kV line will begin  in early 2003. Both Citizens and Tucson Electric Power  has indicated that it is interested in eventually extending  the line into Mexico.  Progress Energy to Buy Westchester Gas for  US$153 million  Progress Energy, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, is to  buy Westchester Gas, a privately-held natural gas company,  based in Jonesville, Texas for US$153 million. Of the total  purchase price, US$135 million will be in the form of  equity and the remainder in cash, with the deal expected  to close in the first quarter of this year. Progress Energy  will acquire the assets of Westchester Gas, which includes  215 producing gas wells, 52 miles of pipeline, and 170  miles of gas-gathering systems in Texas and Louisiana.  In addition, Progress Energy will acquire gas reserves of  140bcf and an annual production capacity of 12bcf. The  company plans to sell natural gas for Westchester Gas  operations on the wholesale market.  Gaz De France Acquires 10% Stake in India’s  Petronet LNG  Gaz De France (GDF) has picked up a 10% equity stake  in Petronet LNG, a company that has been formed in a  joint venture between India’s Oil PSUs – Indian Oil,  Natural Gas Corporation, Gas Authority of India, and  Bharat Petroleum. Gaz De France has been involved with  Petronet by providing technical advice for the purpose of  setting up tow LNG import facilities in the ports of Dahej  and Kochi at a cost of approximately US$1 billion. GDF  has committed US$25 million for its equity stake and it  has already paid US$5 million.                         Korean Government Set to Privatize Five Power  Companies by 2005  The Korean Government has set a goal of gradually  privatizing five power companies by 2005 in a draft plan  from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy. The  plan, which will be put to a public hearing, will be  implemented in two stages, starting with the sale of  managerial rights of two companies followed by the  privatization of the remaining three companies by 2005.  The Korean Government is to select a consultant by early  February and select at least one company by the first half  of this year for disinvestment. The plan also calls for a  foreign investment cap that equals 30% of Korea’s total  power generation capacity during the privatization  program. However, no restriction on foreign investments  will apply to the privatization of the first company. After  which, foreign investment cap limits for the subsequent  disinvestments will be determined by the resulting foreign  investments in the first company. The one exception, for  foreign investors from the 30% limit is when they seek a  minority stake in the companies by joining a consortium,  where they bid with Korean companies  Shaw Group Signs Deal to Build Nuclear Power  Plant  The Shaw Group has concluded an agreement with two  South African firms, PBMR Pty and Murray and Roberts,  to build South Africa’s second nuclear power plant. The  plant is to be developed as a test plant and is projected to  begin commercial operations by 2003. The companies  are considering building the plant in Koeberg, a suburb of  Cape Town. As of 1999, South Africa received 7% of its  power production from nuclear generation, with the  remaining 93% of the nation’s energy generated from fossil  fuels.  European Commission Clears Hydropower JV  The European Commission approved a joint venture for  hydropower production between E.ON Energie and  Verbund of Austria. Under the terms of the joint venture,  the two companies will pool their hydropower production  facilities and ownership stakes in hydropower producers  Capital Markets  The Prometheus File  Page 15                                                          www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  into the joint venture company, which is to be called  European Hydro Power.  Under the European  Commission’s approval, the new company will not directly  trade in power markets but will produce electricity for its  parents, who will continue to sell power to market  participants.  Antrim Energy Signs Agreement with Swift  Energy of New Zealand  Antrim Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadianbased  Antrim has entered into an agreement with Swift  Energy New Zealand. Under the agreement, Antrim will  sell all of its assets in New Zealand to Swift Energy. These  assets include a 5% stake in the Rimu-Kauri permit and a  7.5% interest in the Huinga permit. Under the agreement,  Antrim will receive 220,000 shares of Swift, and between  US$880,000 to US$960,000 in cash, with final details  being determined at closing. Based on the January 14,  2002 closing stock price of Swift shares, a fair value for  the participation rights, and the cash component of the  purchase price, Antrim is slated to receive a total of US$10  million for the deal. The transaction is expected to close  in 1Q02 and has an effective date of November 1, 2001.  PG&E National Energy Looking to Sell Power  Assets  PG&E National Energy is considering putting its  Manchester Street power plant in Rhode Island and three  power plants located in Massachusetts up for sale. The  three plants include the Salem Harbor Station in Salem,  the 589MW Bear Swamp hydroelectric facility in Rowe,  and a 780MW coal plant. PG&E had bought the  Manchester Street plant in 1998 for US$1.59 billion and  is selling these assets to diversify its holdings by  broadening its national presence. The company has  solicited bids from a targeted consortium of companies  and is planning to make a decision to sell by March of this  year. Any sale of assets would require regulatory approval  and is not expected to affect PG&E’s customers.  Ukraine Embarks on Electricity Distribution  Privatization Program  Ukraine is planning to privatize 12 electricity distribution  companies in the second half of this year. The privatization  tenders are expected to be announced in April with the    sale taking place in summer and autumn of this year,  pending market conditions. The program is being run by  the state property fund, and Credit Suisse First Boston  has been selected to offer Investment banking advice for  the program. The sale, if it goes through, will revive  Ukraine’s stalled privatization program which has been  frozen for six months.  Brazil’s Parana State Abandons Plan to Sell Copel  Brazil’s Parana State has abandoned plans to sell its power  company, Compania Paranaense de Energia (Copel) due  to the introduction of new federal regulations that allow  for more federal government protection. The new  regulations aim to further protect state-owned companies  from the effects of greater competition once the electricity  market is opened in 2003. Parana State officials believe  that greater state protection will enable Copel to postpone  its privatization plans. Eleven companies were in the  process of bidding for a 45% stake in Copel. Following  Parana State’s decision to cancel the sale of Copel, Banco  Itau, the second largest private bank in Brazil, decided to  sell its 8% stake in Copel. This decision is expected to  lead to a fall in Copel’s share price, which has already  fallen 14% to date this year.  RWE to Bid for Minority Stakes in Three Slovak  Electricity Companies  RWE said it will bid for minority stakes in all three Slovak  regional electricity distributors being privatized by the  Slovak government. Under the privatization program, 49%  stakes in Zapadoslovenska Energetika, Stredoslovenska  Energetika, and Vychodoslovenska Energetika are to be  sold. Preliminary bids are due by the end of this month  with the government choosing the winning bids by the  end of March.  Nigeria to Go Ahead with Sale of State-Owned  Power Company  Nigeria’s government plans to push ahead with the sale  of state-owned National Electric Power Authority (NEPA)  this year despite an investigation into the formerly stateowned  African Petroleum Company on corruption charges  for hiding debt balances from external auditors. Nigeria  Page 16                                                       The Prometheus File  www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  is in talks with the IMF to schedule a three-year loan  package and plans to set up a power regulatory body by  mid-year. The government plans to start seeking advisers  and conduct due-diligence of NEPA during the first half  of this year, and hopes to begin tenders for some units of  NEPA by the end of the year.  Italy’s Edison Group Outlines Future Direction for  the Company  The chairman of the Italian energy group, Edison, told a  parliamentary commission that the group plans to remain  on course to become the second-largest company in the  Italian electricity sector behind Enel, while at the same  time will pursue opportunities to diversify in Europe in  conjunction with French electricity provider, EdF. The  company has set an installed capacity target of 8,000MW  and plans to reach this target by acquiring Eurogen, ENEL’s  generation subsidiary, and by constructing new brown field  power stations. The company is also planning to make  investments in the range of US$2.3 billion to US$2.7  billion and to reach cash flow break-even status during  the course of this year. As part of this strategy, the company  has embarked on a program to sell its non-strategic assets  from which it expects EUR7 billion (US$6.17 billion) in  capital gains, which will lead to a reduction in the  company’s debt load to •7 billion (US$6.17 billion).  Edison also plans to sign an agreement next week to exploit  a large Egyptian gas field as part of its strategy to keep up  with Enel.  SEC Approves Niagara Mohawk and National Grid  USA Merger  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  has approved the US$3 billion acquisition of Niagara  Mohawk by National Grid USA, creating the ninth-largest  utility in the U.S. The acquisition is expected to close on  January 31. As a result, the new National Grid USA will  serve an estimated 3.2 million customers spread over  29,450 square miles in four states and will have operating  revenues in the range of US$6.7 billion. As part of the  deal, Niagara Mohawk will continue to operate in the form  of a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Grid, and  maintain its headquarters in Syracuse, NY. The companies  expect to realize savings over a 10 year period of US$1  billion. Following the acquisition, consumers will be    provided with an immediate 8% reduction in electricity  delivery charges, which would translate into approximately  a 5% decline in monthly customer electricity bills. Under  the terms of the merger agreement, Niagara Mohawk  shareholders will receive US$18.89 per share.  The Prometheus File  Page 17                                                          www.reedwasden.com  Reed Wasden Research  Notable Earnings  FPL Group said its 4Q01 earnings increased by 82%  from last year, when the company had a US$41 million  onetime charge due to its failed acquisition of Entergy.  Net income increased by 82% to US$118 million from  US$65 million in 2000. Revenue declined by 1% to  US$1.84 billion from US$1.86 billion as a result of  economic slowdown in the U.S. FPL and Entergy canceled  their proposed merger in April primarily because of  disputes over management of the combined company.  After the merger, FPL continues to add customers at its  Florida Power & Light utility and build more power plants  outside the state. While many utilities have struggled as  power prices have plummeted, FPL protected itself  primarily by leveraging off of its traditional utility  operations and locked-in contracts for power sales. FPL’s  investment grade rating for long-term debt from Standard                                     & Poor’s also appears to contribute to the stability of its  shares.  Duke Energy announced that its 4Q01 net income  decreased by 21% primarily as a result of low power prices,  poor weather conditions, and a weak economy. Net income  declined to US$225 million, or US$0.28/share, from  US$284 million, or US$0.38/share a year ago. Revenue  decreased by 30% to US$10.7 billion from US$15.4  billion. According to consensus estimates, Duke was  expected to earn US$0.45/share in 4Q. In 2000, on-going  EPS for 2001 increased by 26% to US$2.64 from US$2.10.  Revenue increased by 21% to US$60 billion. Including  non-recurring items, Duke reported US$2.44/share in 2001  diluted EPS, compared to US$2.38/share in 2000. Duke’s  wholesale energy segment reported strong EBIT growth  in FY01, an increase of 211% from last year. However,    overall earnings result was nearly 8% short compared to  consensus estimates of US$2.84/share. Shares of Duke  trade at US$6.98/share during mid-day January 17, 2001,  down 1.02% from the previous day. We had expected weak  4Q01results because of milder weather, lower power  prices, and a weak economy in the sector. Despite these  negative elements, Duke’s North American Wholesale  segment showed strong EBIT growth. However, in light  of weak wholesale power prices and a recessionary  economy, we will carefully review Duke’s strategic plans  as well as fundamentals.  Consolidated Edison, announced 4Q profits increased  by 15% due to the lower power, fuel, and natural gas prices  as well as reduced operating costs after September 11.  Despite a decrease in 14% to US$1.94 billion from  US$2.25 billion, net income surged to US$128.5 million,  or US$0.59/share after preferred dividends, from US$111.7  million, or US$0.53/share a year earlier. The company  reported FY01 net income for common stock of US$682.2  million, or US$3.22/share, compared with earnings of  US$582.8 million, or US$2.75/share for FY00. Earnings  for FY00 included non-recurring charges of approximately  US$162 million, or US$0.49/share, for nuclear  replacement power and merger-related costs. Excluding  these charges, 2000 earnings would have been US$3.24/  share. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of  US$0.555share on its common stock, payable March 15,  2002 to stockholders of record as of February 13, 2002.

Dominion announced that FY01 operating earnings,  excluding special charges, are expected to meet or slightly  exceed analyst expectations of US$4.15/share. The  company also reaffirmed 2002 earnings guidance of  US$4.90 to US$4.95/share. However, the company  expects to take an after-tax charge of approximately  US$348 million in 4Q01 due to exposure to Enron of  US$97 million, a write-down of Dominion Capital assets  of US$183 million, and restructuring charges associated  with a senior management restructuring initiative  announced in November and other restructuring costs of  US$68 million. The Enron charge is related to credit  exposure on prior energy sales of US$6 million and the  impaired value of forward natural gas contracts in the  amount of US$91 million, for which payment has not yet  been received. Dominion indicated that moving forward  there will be no further charges related to Enron. Dominion  remains confident about meeting consensus estimates of  US$4.89/share in 2002 and annual earnings growth of  10%.  Intel announced 4Q01 earnings of US$0.15/share,  excluding acquisition-related costs, and beating consensus  estimates by 37%. However, Intel also announced that it  does not expect FY02 to be as strong as previously  projected. The company also stated that it will cut its  budget during the year, and cut capex by approximately  US$1.8 billion. The move to cut capital spending by 25%  was more drastic than anticipated. In line with these  moves, Intel laid off 7,000 employees through FY01, 2,000  more than initially planned. The news sent the Philadelphia  Semiconductor Index downwards, along with nearly all  semiconductor stocks, leading to conclusions that a broad  and quick semiconductor recovery is still very far away.  Some of the Reed Wasden Research Power Semiconductor  stocks were affected by the Intel news by nearly 10%. We  believe this is the first collapse of support levels that will  bring semiconductors down in the short-term.

Forgiveness does not mean that you must tolerate sin. Isabel, a young wife and mother attending one of my conferences, told me of her decision to forgive her mother for continually manipulating her for attention. But Isabel tearfully continued, "She is no different. Am I supposed to let her keep ruining my life?"  No, forgiving someone doesn't mean that you must be a doormat to their continual sin. I encouraged Isabel to confront her mother lovingly but firmly, and tell her that she would no longer tolerate destructive manipulation. It's okay to forgive another's past sins and, at the same time, take a stand against future sins. Forgiving is not a co-dependent activity.  Forgiveness does not demand revenge or repayment for offenses suffered. "You mean I'm just supposed to let them off the hook?" you may argue. Yes, you let them off your hook, realizing that they are not off God's hook. You may feel like exacting justice, but you are not an impartial judge. God is the just Judge who will make everything right (Romans 12:19). Your job is to extend the mercy of forgiveness and leave judgment up to God.  Forgiveness is agreeing to live with the consequences of another person's sin. Suppose that someone in your church says, "I have gossiped about you. Will you forgiven me?" You can't retract gossip any easier than you can put toothpaste back into the tube. You're going to live with the gossip this person spread about you no matter how you respond to the gossiper.  We are all living with the consequences of another person's sin: Adam's. The only real choice we have in the matter is to live in the bondage of bitterness or in the freedom of forgiveness.  Heavenly Father, I give up my right to seek revenge or harbor resentment. I want to enjoy the freedom which comes from forgiving others.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The principles of Custom Broadband Inc. have several years of satellite transmission experience, and will be able to provide this service to the company.  The world airline industry has approximately 12,000 (information obtained from Boeing) active passenger and commercial aircraft in service at this time. The cost per aircraft is not static as each airline configures floor plans differently, and each model of aircraft will have different requirements based on divisions of floor plan, and layout of security sensitive areas. The company anticipates that on board costs for a Boeing 767 for example would be close to $5,000, and $10,000 per 747, with a cost of $20,000 per ground unit. Each ground unit will service 20 aircraft on an immediate tracking base for the local area of departing and incoming flights, and with the addition of Custom Broadband Inc. the ground unit can track a aircraft world wide if desired. The recurring revenue stream from data transition will be paid to Synergetic Technologies Inc. on a per minute bases with a 20% built in profit over and above transmission costs. These charges will be collected weekly using electronic bank transactions.  The addition of Custom Broadband Inc. also allows the company to broadcast images worldwide from any moving or stationary platform. This is considered a very important part of the development path for 2 additional products that will be made available for the home and retail market using very similar technologies based on a home computer, to provide worldwide access to home and personal property surveillance using portions of the ICU Security System Inc. platform.  Although it is hard to put a dollar figure on the future business of this company the future is very bright and the company looks forward to active beta tests in the very near future. Investors should be advised that these are developmental stage companies and technologies. However it is the goal of Synergetic Technologies Inc. to provide a vertical integration into this industry and be able to provide these services at very competitive rates.

The life of Wilma Rudolph, the great Olympic sprinter, is a remarkable story of faith. Wilma was born with health problems that left her crippled. "Will I ever be able to run and play like the other children?" Wilma asked her parents.  "Honey, you have to believe in God and never give up hope," they responded. "If you believe, God will make it happen." Taking her parents' counsel, she painfully struggled to walk. By the time she was 12, to the delight and surprise of many, Wilma no longer needed her braces. She went on to play basketball on her championship high school team and win three gold medals in the 1960 Olympics.  When you hear inspiring stories of faith like Wilma Rudolph's, do you sometimes wonder, "What could I accomplish if I took God at His Word?" Faith is the foundational principle of the Christian life. Believing who God is, what He says, what He has done, and what He will do defines the kingdom of God.  Furthermore, faith is the essence of the Christian's day-to-day activity. Paul wrote: "As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him" (Colossians 2:6). How did you receive Christ? By faith. How then are you to walk in Him? By faith. In Scripture, walking refers to the way you conduct your everyday life. Victorious Christian living and spiritual maturity are determined by our belief in God.  We tend to think of faith as some kind of mystical quality which belongs only in the realm of the spiritual. But everybody walks by faith. It is the most basic operating principle of life. The question is, in what or in whom do you believe? We are challenged to believe in God and take His Word seriously.  Thank You, Lord, that Your Word stands forever in heaven.

His desire is for us to know Him and the power of His resurrection. These mandates deal with our relationship with Him. The fruit of this relationship must then result in our glorifying Him by completing the work He has given each of us to do. It will become a by-product of this relationship, not an end in itself.  What is the work God has called you to do? Jesus never did anything the Father had not instructed Him to do. He lived in such communion with the Father that He knew when to turn left and when to turn to the right. Is it possible to have such a relationship with our heavenly Father? I think that if it weren't, He would not have given us such an example.  "Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know" (Jer. 33:3). What has He called you to do? Perhaps you are called to be the best CPA in your city or the best advertising executive or the best office worker or assembly-line person in your company. Whatever work He has called you to do, He will use you as His instrument to accomplish something that He has uniquely prepared you to do.  When our life is complete, what a glorious day it will be if we can each say, "I have completed the work You gave me to do." This will have brought great glory to Him.

We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.  I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

How does God intend for you to resolve hurtful, controlling past experiences? In two ways which we shall consider today and tomorrow.  First, you have the privilege of evaluating your past experience in the light of who you are now, as opposed to who you were then. The intensity of the primary emotion was established by how you perceived the event at the time it happened. Remember: Your emotions are a product of how you perceived the event, not the event itself. As a Christian, you are not primarily a product of your past; you are primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross. The flesh, which represents how you processed those events according to the world and without Christ, remains. But you are able to render it inoperative.  When a present event activates that primary emotion, many people believe what they feel instead of believing what is true. For example, people who have been verbally abused by their parents have a hard time believing they are unconditionally loved by Father God. Their primary emotions argue that they are unlovable to a parent figure. They believe what they feel and their walk is off course. Believing the truth and walking by faith is what sets us free.  Now that you are in Christ, you can look at those events from the perspective of who you are today. Christ is in your life right now desiring to set you free from your past. That is the gospel, the good news that Christ has come to set the captives free. Perceiving those events from the perspective of your new identity in Christ is what starts the process of healing those damaged emotions.  God's good news about our identity is revealed in 2 Corinthians 5:17: "Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come." This is what you must believe first in order to be set free from your past.  Loving Lord, thank You for making me a new creation in Christ. Help me walk away from anything in my past that is restricting my freedom.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Fri, 19 Oct 2001 00:10:12 +0200 (CEST) Subject: UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses From: Enron Global Technology@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Global+20Technology+40ENRON@ENRON.com> To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-All+20Enron+20Worldwide+40ENRON@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 778260 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-309.eml   Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.   We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.   If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.   Thank you for your support.   Enron Global Technology       -----Original Message-----  From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration  Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM  To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON  Cc:  Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses    Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.  Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.  To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.  IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.  We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.  Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60 cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1 reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 - $6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The whole transaction took less than a year.   TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP  PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.  The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites certain caveats including that ``...these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by TSYI....''  The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In conclusion, the process and its potential application to utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''  Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization, including those mentioned in this report. But, we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''  Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is presently a development-stage company. It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state, using air as the medium of movement. This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials. Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry-process technology. This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures, including: drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction, Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation, agriculture, mining, environment, construction, ceramics, and materials transportation. We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years, if adopted for implementation in several large projects. Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18 million shares currently outstanding.

Date: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 13:55:34 +0200 (CEST) Subject: All-Employee Meeting From: Public Relations@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Public+20Relations+40ENRON@ENRON.com> To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-All+20Enron+20Worldwide+40ENRON@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 778239 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-288.eml  The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.    As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.  Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.  Video Teleconferencing The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.     There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.   Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

What comes to mind when you hear the terms false prophets and false teachers? Many people tend to thing of Eastern mystics and gurus, the spokespersons for nonbiblical religions or dynamic cult leaders--people who are recognizably outside the boundaries of the Christian church. But the apostle Peter devoted an entire chapter in one of his letters (2 Peter 2) to false prophets and teachers who operate within the church. False teachers may operate in our churches disguised as workers of righteousness.  Notice that the lure of false teachers is not primarily their doctrine: "And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned" (verse 2). What does Peter mean by "follow their sensuality"? He is talking about Christians who evaluate a ministry based on the outward appearance and charm of its leaders. We say, "He's such a nice guy"; "She's a very charismatic person"; "He's a real dynamic speaker"; "She's so sweet and sounds so sincere." But is physical attractiveness or a syrupy personality a biblical criterion for validating a ministry or a teacher? Of course not! The issue is always truth and righteousness. A Christian leader should be identified by his commitment to the truth, his righteous life and his servant's heart.  Dear God, keep me from playing to the grandstand; I want only to live for You. Keep me accountable as a person of truth, righteousness, and love, ever fearful of discrediting Your name.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

MILITARY RESALE GROUP as BCTL, a public company, now has greater access to capital. MILITARY RESALE GROUP last week announced they have increased their space 3 times. Watch for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.  Military Market Segment Is Hot.   MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS PRODUCT LINE  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid industry, has been added to its product supplier network.  Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000 annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.  President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group is pleased and complimented to have become able to represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our distribution activities. We have previously forecast that we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000 to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new presence is expected to make a major contribution to this $1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''  Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were $750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now a publicly owned company as a result of its recent acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).  The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market, with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The competitive structure of the Military Resale Market consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post- acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by internal growth.

Date: Mon, 18 Jun 2001 11:08:46 +0200 (CEST) Subject: Neil Anderson Devotional for Monday, June 18, 2001 From: Crosswalk.com neilanderson@lists.crosswalk.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-+22Crosswalk+2Ecom+22+20+3Cneilanderson+40lists+2Ecrosswalk+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com> To: King  Jeff <Jeff.King@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 57610 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-159.eml    N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L              from Freedom in Christ Ministries  June 18  The Fleshly Person  I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. (1 Corinthians 3: 2,3).  The spirit of the fleshly person is identical to that of the spiritual person. The fleshly person is a Christian, spiritually alive in Christ and declared righteous by God. But that's where the similarity ends. Instead of being directed by the Spirit, this believer chooses to follow the impulses of his flesh. As a result, his mind is occupied by carnal thoughts and his emotions are plagued by negative feelings. And though he is free to choose to walk after the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit, he continues to involve himself in sinful activity by willfully walking after the flesh.  His physical body is a temple of God, but he is using it as an instrument of unrighteousness. He has the same troubling physical symptoms experienced by the natural person because he is not operating in the manner God created him to operate. He is not presenting his body to God as a living sacrifice. Since he yields to the flesh instead of crucifying it, the fleshly man is also subject to feelings of inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt.  Several years ago I did some research to discover how many Christians are still the victims of their flesh. I asked the same question to 50 consecutive Christians who came to me to talk about problems in their lives: "How many of the following characteristics describe your life: inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt:" Every one of the 50 answered, "All six." Here were 50 born-again, righteous children of God who were so bogged down by the flesh that they struggled with the same problems of self-doubt which inundate unbelivers who only live in the flesh.  If I asked you the same question, how would you answer? I imagine that many of you would admit that some or all of these six traits describe you. It is evident to me that a staggering number of believers are still confused about their spiritual identity in Christ and its implications for their daily lives. We are struggling with the behavior aspect of our growth because we are still struggling with the belief aspect of our growth: who we are in Christ.

Knowing the will of God is not just a twentieth-century problem. People were struggling at the time of Christ. Some people were saying of Him, "He's a good man." Others were saying, "He leads the multitude astray" (see John 7:12). How could these people know whether He was leading them into truth?  Seizing the opportunity, Jesus set forth standards of divine guidance. His first admonition was, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself" (John 7:16, 17). The essential prerequisite to know the will of God, according to Jesus, is a willingness to do it.  What is the will of God? God's will for those who believe in Him is to be alive in Christ for the purpose of establishing His kingdom by overcoming the evil one and becoming fully the people He has called us to be. Notice the opening words of the Lord's Prayer: "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:9, 10). When praying this prayer, we are asking for God's will to be accomplished on earth as it presently is in heaven. Apparently God's will is being perfectly executed in heaven but not on earth.  Are you totally committed to do God's will without knowing for sure what it is? Do you hold any reservations about turning your will over to God? Do you really believe that God's will for you is good, acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:2)? If God is God and you call Him Lord, doesn't He have the right to exercise His will in your life?  Father, may Your will be accomplished in my thoughts, words and deeds today as it is being accomplished in heaven.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60 cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1 reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 - $6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The whole transaction took less than a year.   TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP  PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.  The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites certain caveats including that ``...these general conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by TSYI....''  The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In conclusion, the process and its potential application to utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''  Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive conclusions about our technology that this report has reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving successful commercialization, including those mentioned in this report. But, we also feel this study provides substantial professional support for the faith we have in the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''  Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is presently a development-stage company. It is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of its patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state, using air as the medium of movement. This technology operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly traditional alternative for processing bulk materials. Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in basic industries can be more economically separated and classified by our dry-process technology. This capability facilitates a number of associated procedures, including: drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction, Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many applications in an array of large industries including power generation, agriculture, mining, environment, construction, ceramics, and materials transportation. We estimate that our technology could generate economic returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years, if adopted for implementation in several large projects. Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18 million shares currently outstanding.

What did we gain by carrying out His requirements and going about like mourners before the Lord Almighty? But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly the evildoers prosper, and even those who challenge God escape." - (Malachi 3:14-15)   Have you ever felt that serving God had little reward and the ungodly seemed actually to be more blessed than you? This is what the people of God felt. God heard their cry and responded through the prophet Malachi to explain God's view on this matter.  Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in His presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored His name. "They will be Mine," says the Lord Almighty, "in the day when I make up My treasured possession. I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him. And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not" (Malachi 3:16-18).  Notice that after the people complained about this, they began to talk to each other, and the Lord listened and heard. God had been taking note of those who were serving Him and honoring Him. There is a day coming in which God will honor His "treasured possessions." We will see that there is a distinction between the righteous and the wicked on that day when "the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall" (Mal. 4:2). What a beautiful picture of what we will feel like on that day.  Faithful obedience is rewarded by God. It often requires patience, suffering, and perseverance. Be of good cheer; He will reward you if you faint not.

The second step in resolving past conflicts is to forgive those who have offended you. After encouraging Cindy, a rape victim, to deal with the emotional trauma of her rape, I said, "Cindy, you also need to forgive the man who raped you." Cindy's response was typical of many believers who have suffered physical, sexual or emotional pain at the hands of others: "Why should I forgive him? You don't know how badly he hurt me!"  "He's still hurting you, Cindy," I responded. "Forgiveness is how you stop the pain. You don't forgive him for his sake; you do it for your sake."  Why should you forgive those who have hurt you in the past?  First, forgiveness is required by God. As soon as Jesus spoke the amen to His model prayer--which included a petition for God's forgiveness--He commented: "If you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions" (Matthew 6:14, 15). We must base our relationships with others on the same criteria on which God bases His relationship with us: love, acceptance and forgiveness (Matthew 18:21-35).  Second, forgiveness is necessary to avoid entrapment by Satan. I have discovered from my counseling that unforgiveness is the number one avenue Satan uses to gain entrance to believers' lives. Paul encouraged mutual forgiveness "in order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes" (2 Corinthians 2:11). Unforgiveness is an open invitation to Satan's bondage in our lives.  Third, we are to forgive like Christ forgave in order to keep our hearts from bitterness. Paul wrote: "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you" (Ephesians 4:31, 32).  Your act of forgiveness will set the captive free, then you will realize that the captive was you!  Lord, teach me to forgive others from my heart as You have forgiven me.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a condition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade power in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would improve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test based on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in serving peak electricity loads. "If you're big enough to control the market at the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you," said FERC Chairman Pat Wood.   Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tremendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state regulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates, which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrinking profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this ruling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experienced in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can also be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is using to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizations (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairman Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale markets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represents a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prompt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.   Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charge unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. Instead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) have been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately applying its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power separate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined that these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power "test," a generator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electricity is "pivotal" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a price above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a dramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's main criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power needed in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal level.   There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not eliminated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where the grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is significant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there are secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current ruling only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not impacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term contracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not included in the new ruling.   The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposals to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charge for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered by an independent third party.   The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique known as "split the savings." The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies identified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot power into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers who want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not producing or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions will be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decremental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transaction price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, sellers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous day and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potentially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours to evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of the drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows the purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original incremental bid and competing around the seller's price.   Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred.   I made a previous reference to the "big stick" that FERC is carrying related to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood had threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger applications, advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the deregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Company, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be subsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhibited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding national RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three utilities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Southern Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading and previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets over the next five years.   Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single dissenting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evaluate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contested, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued statements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which the ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for possible litigation.   Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a handful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illustrates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this could be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to other wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time. Third, the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught with its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market over power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in the bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruling is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impacts AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deemed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have also not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three companies are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked that the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now will gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could substantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted.

In his book The Sensation of Being Somebody, Maurice Wagner expresses a false belief in simple equations we tend to accept. He says we mistakenly think that good appearance plus the admiration it brings equals a whole person. Or we feel that star performance plus accomplishments equals a whole person. Or we believe that a certain amount of status plus the recognition we accumulate equals a whole person. Not so. These equations are no more correct than two plus two equals six. Wagner says: "Try as we might by our appearance, performance, or social status to find self-verification for a sense of being somebody, we always come short of satisfaction. Whatever pinnacle of self-identity we achieve soon crumbles under the pressure of hostile rejection or criticism, introspection or guilt, fear or anxiety. We cannot do anything to qualify for the by-product of being loved unconditionally and voluntarily" (Maurice Wagner, The Sensation of Being Somebody, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House, 1975, p. 163).  If these equations could work for anyone, they would have worked for King Solomon. He was the king of Israel during the greatest years in her history. If a meaningful life is the result of appearance, admiration, performance, accomplishments, status, or recognition, Solomon would have been the most together man who ever lived.  But God also gave the king an extra dose of wisdom to interpret his achievements. What was his commentary on it all? "Meaningless! Meaningless! . . . Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless" (Ecclesiastes 1:2 NIV). Take the advice of the wise king: All the stuff and status you can acquire don't add up to personal wholeness. Millions of people climb those ladders to success, only to discover when they reach the top that they are leaning against the wrong wall! The only identity equation that works in God's kingdom is you plus Christ equals wholeness and meaning.  Heavenly Father, I affirm that nothing in this world can make me more complete than I already am in Christ.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.

This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture.

This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results.   	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.  	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.  	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

(Jeremiah 23:29).  If you attend a Christian fellowship where prophecies are part of public worship, I wonder if we should expect from God generic messages like, "I love you, My children" or "I'm coming soon." These statements are certainly true, but why would they need to be prophesied, since the Bible already clearly asserts God's love and Christ's imminent return? I have heard "prophecies" like these given in churches where many people were living in sin, lulling them into an unrighteous complacency.  The voice of a prophet is a consuming fire and a shattering hammer. A prophetic message should motivate people to righteousness, not placate them in their sin (1 Peter 4:17). God is more concerned about church purity than about church growth. Comfort only comes to those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake by allowing God's Word to purge their sin and shatter their self-centeredness.  Jeremiah relates two other evidences of false prophets: "'Behold, I am against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who steal My words from each other'" (23:30). That's plagiarism: taking what God gave someone else and using it as if it were your own. "'I am against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who use their tongues and declare, "the Lord declares"'" (verse 31).  Declaring that what you are saying is directly from the Lord when it isn't is an incredible offense to God. If God wants me to know something He will tell me directly. I believe in the priesthood of believers; however, God can and will encourage us and confirm His Word to us through others. "There is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5). If someone says to you "God told me to tell you . . ." that person may be functioning as a medium. The gift of prophecy should reveal the secrets of the heart so people will fall on their faces and worship God (1 Corinthians 14:25). Then God will guide them by His Holy Spirit.  Lord, teach me not to quench Your Spirit nor to despise prophetic utterances but to examine everything and hold fast to what is good.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

If you believe that you are part light and part darkness, part saint and part sinner, you will live in a very mediocre manner with little to distinguish you from the non-Christian. You may confess your proneness to sin and strive to do better, but you will live a continually defeated life because you perceive yourself to be only a sinner saved by grace who is hanging on until the rapture. Satan knows he can do nothing about who you really are, but if he can get you to believe you are no different from the natural person, then you will behave no differently from the natural person.  Why does this profile describe so many Christians? Because we are ignorant of our true identity in Christ. God's work of atonement in changing sinners to saints is His greatest accomplishment on earth. The inner change, justification, is effected at the moment of salvation. The outer change in the believer's daily walk, sanctification, continues throughout life. But the progressive work of sanctification is only fully effective when the radical, inner transformation of justification is realized and appropriated by faith.  "But didn't I read somewhere that Paul referred to himself as the chief of sinners?" you may wonder. Yes, but he was referring to his nature before his conversion to Christ (1 Timothy 1:12-16). He made a similar statement of self-depreciation in 1 Corinthians 15:9, but continued by saying: "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain" (verse 10). Paul knew that who he was before Christ and who he became in Christ were two separate identities.  If you claim to be just a sinner, what will you do? You will sin! You are professing that sin is at the core of your identity. That's not what the Bible teaches. Why don't we just believe God that Jesus is at the core of our being and then begin to live like it by His Spirit?  Thank You, Father, that I am complete in Your Son Jesus and that my identity is rooted in Him and not in my sin.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   "Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Os Hillman, president of Marketplace Leaders, located in Atlanta, GA.

Your face, LORD, I will seek (Psalm 27:8 NIV).  "If the sun is shining in the morning, I'll do it." "If he's there when I open the door, I'll know he's the one." "If I pass the class on world missions, I'll be a missionary. If not, I'll be a local pastor."  We all know better than this, but it's amazing how often scenarios just like these pop into our minds. Such propositions are referred to as "laying a fleece" before the Lord or "seeking a sign."  The term fleece comes from the account of Gideon. In Judges 6, Gideon is called by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites. Gideon questions whether God is even for Israel (verse 13), and he doubts his own ability (verse 15). So he asks God for a sign (verse 17). God gives him one, then tells him to tear down the altar of Baal. Gideon is afraid to go during the day, so he goes at night.  Then he questions again whether God will deliver Israel. This time he puts a lamb's fleece on the ground. If God will deliver Israel, then the lamb's fleece will be wet in the morning and the ground around it will be dry. The next morning it is so. That ought to satisfy him, right? Wrong! Wanting to be sure, and hoping that God won't get too mad, Gideon asks Him to do it again, but this time with the opposite result (i.e., the fleece dry and the ground wet). Not exactly the stuff heroes are made of. But God answers Gideon's request and then He reduces Gideon's army down to 300 men!  The whole point of the passage is that God, not man, is the deliverer. God chose a man desperately seeking assurance and reduced an army down to nothing so that the victory would clearly be His. The fleece wasn't a means of demonstrating faith; it was just the opposite. And it certainly wasn't used to determine God's will. God had already told Gideon what to do. Gideon was questioning the integrity of God, just as we do if we ask for a fleece when God has already shown us His will. "An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign" (Matthew 12:39). As God's people, let's seek the face of God.  Lord, forgive me for the times I have looked for sign instead of seeking Your face. I commit myself today to walk only in the faith revealed in Your Word.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:  Week of Jan 28:  We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:  Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist  External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration  Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List  Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.  A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.  The Splash page will look something like the following:      Week of Feb. 4:  We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.  Week of Feb. 11:  The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).   General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. 		  Trading/Origination Coordination  The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.   UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:  For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

They saw the works of the Lord.... - (Psalms 107:23-24)   When you were a child, perhaps you may have gone to the ocean for a vacation. I recall wading out until the waves began crashing on my knees. As long as I could stand firm, the waves were of no concern to me. However, as I moved farther and farther into the ocean, I had less control over my ability to stand. Sometimes the current was so strong it moved me down the beach, and I even lost my bearings at times. But I have never gone so far into the ocean that I was not able to control the situation.  Sometimes God takes us into such deep waters that we lose control of the situation, and we have no choice but to fully trust in His care for us. This is doing business in great waters. It is in these great waters that we see the works of God.  The Scriptures tell us that the disciples testified of what they saw and heard. It was the power behind the gospel, not the words themselves, that changed the world. The power wasn't seen until circumstances got to the point that there were no alternatives but God. Sometimes God has to take us into the deep water in order to give us the privilege to see His works.  Sometimes God takes us into the deep waters of life for an extended time. Joseph was taken into deep waters of adversity for 17 years. Rejection by his brothers, enslavement to Pharaoh, and imprisonment were the deep waters for Joseph. During those deep waters, he experienced dreams, a special anointing of his gifts to administrate, and great wisdom beyond his years. The deep water was preparation for a task that was so great he never could have imagined it. He was to see God's works more clearly than anyone in his generation. God had too much at stake for a 30-year-old to mess it up. So, God took Joseph through the deep waters of preparation to ensure that he would survive what he was about to face. Pride normally engulfs such young servants who have such access to power at such a young age.  If God chooses to take us into deep waters, it is for a reason. The greater the calling, the deeper the water. Trust in His knowledge that your deep waters are preparation to see the works of God in your life.

X-SDOC: 57649 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-198.eml  Subject: Access Card Information  Dear Colleagues,  We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.   Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.  I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.  David Oxley Human Resources ____________________________________________________________________  Access Cards  There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.  Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.  There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.  It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.  Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter: 5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,  The Sky Ring  Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.  Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter: Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor  Ardmore Data Center.  Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.  Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

After Jesus claimed to be sent by God, some were seeking to seize Him, having come to the conclusion that He was not a good man. But others did believe in Him, "and they were saying, 'When the Christ shall come, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?'" (John 7:31). All the evidence was there. Some chose to believe; others chose not to. People do the same today. Faith is a choice. We choose to believe or not believe.  Faith is the operating principle of life. It is the means by which we relate to God and live our lives in freedom. Notice the variety of ways stated in Scripture by which faith affects our lives.  First, we are saved by faith (Ephesians 2:8, 9).  Second, we "walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7).  Third, being found faithful is a prerequisite for ministry: "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service" (1 Timothy 1:12). Paul then adds, "And the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also" (2 Timothy 2:2). This is more than being reliable, since a person could be counted on to follow through on an assignment and not be a believer. The added ingredient in faithful people is that they know the truth and can be counted on to be reliable.  Fourth, the quality of any relationship is determined by faith or trust: "Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a trustworthy man?" (Proverbs 20:6). The words faith, trust and believe are all the same word (pistis) in the original language. The man who has faith believes in something. The one who believes also trusts, or he doesn't truly believe. There is no concept that looms larger in life than faith because what we believe determines how we live.  Lord, I affirm that I cannot please You without faith. I choose today to believe in You and trust in Your name.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Your children need to see how you handle failure even more than how you handle success. If you make a mistake, you need to own up to it and ask forgiveness if the situation calls for it. If you don't model how to deal with your own fleshly responses, how are they going to learn how to own up to their mistakes and resolve them biblically?  One Sunday morning my daughter wasn't ready when I wanted to leave for church. I fumed about it until I exploded with anger. After the service I was about to say grace before a meal when I felt the convicting hand of God weighing heavily upon me. I stopped and asked my family to forgive me for my outburst of anger. I didn't confess my daughter's tardiness because it wasn't my responsibility. Nor did I ask their forgiveness in hopes that my daughter would own up to her tardiness. I asked their forgiveness because my outburst of anger was a deed of the flesh. I had to ask forgiveness to be right with God myself.  You never lose esteem in your child's eyes when you do what God requires you to do. You gain esteem because you are an honest person, and in the process you are modeling what they need to do when they blow it. Children need models, not critics. Modeling is what establishes our credibility to "bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).  Lord, help me model a life of obedience and honesty before my children and others who look to me as an example. And when I fail, give me grace to admit my mistakes and resolve my conflicts.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 04:15:23 +0200 (CEST) Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses From: Enron Messaging Administration <EnronMessagingAdministration@ENRON.com> To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-All+20Enron+20Worldwide+40ENRON@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 778296 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-345.eml  Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

What is Babylon? Babylon is a system of doing business. The stronghold of the marketplace is mammon and pride. Dependence on money and misplaced trust are at the core of a Babylonian philosophy of life. Revelation 18 describes a time when God will judge this Babylonian system. It is the one place that we see a system destroyed in one day, even one hour. I do not believe Babylon is a particular city, but a world system. "Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her" (Rev. 18:8a). "Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!" (Rev. 18:10b).  As Christian businesspeople we are called to acknowledge the signs of the times. When the Soviet Union fell, many knew it was going to happen because they could recognize the signs of the times. God has a way of shaking things up. These shakings force us to determine who and what we will place our trust in. God says that we are to "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Mt. 22:37).  Are you still living in Babylon in the way you do business? If so, expect to share in the sins of Babylon when God decides to judge her. Ask God to show you where you might be operating in a "Babylonian" system of work.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we "may" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.  In more detail, this is how the process will work:  TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses If not, the TC will be required to self supply  TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

God often takes each leader through four major tests to determine if that person will achieve God's ultimate call on his or her life. The person's response to these tests is the deciding factor in whether they can advance to the next level of responsibility in God's Kingdom.  Control-Control is one of the first tests. Saul spent most of his time as king trying to prevent others from getting what he had. Saul never got to the place with God in which he was a grateful recipient of God's goodness to him. Saul was a religious controller. This control led to disobedience and ultimately being rejected by God because Saul no longer was a vessel God could use.  Bitterness-Every major character in the Bible was hurt by another person at one time or another. Jesus was hurt deeply when Judas, a trusted follower, betrayed Him. Despite knowing this was going to happen, Jesus responded by washing Judas' feet. Every anointed leader will have a Judas experience at one time or another. God watches us to see how we will respond to this test. Will we take up an offense? Will we retaliate? It is one of the most difficult tests to pass.  Power-Power is the opposite of servanthood. Jesus had all authority in Heaven and earth, so satan tempted Jesus at the top of the mountain to use His power to remove Himself from a difficult circumstance. How will we use the power and influence God has entrusted to us? Do we seek to gain more power? There is a common phrase in the investment community, "He who has the gold rules." Jesus modeled the opposite. He was the ultimate servant leader.  Greed-This is a difficult one. Money has the ability to have great influence for either good or bad. When it is a focus in our life, it becomes a tool of destruction. When it is a by-product, it can become a great blessing. Many leaders started out well-only to be derailed once prosperity became a part of their life. There are thousands who can blossom spiritually in adversity; only a few can thrive spiritually under prosperity.  As leaders, we must be aware when we are being tested. You can be confident that each one of these tests will be thrown your way if God calls you for His purposes. Will you pass these tests? Ask for God's grace today to walk through these tests victoriously.   Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life (1 John 5:11, 12 NIV).  When God breathed life into Adam, he was both physically and spiritually alive. Adam was spiritually alive because his soul was in union with God. We were never designed to be separated from God or to live independently of Him. We were born to be spiritually alive.  For the Christian, to be spiritually alive is to be in union with God. This concept is repeatedly presented in Scripture by the prepositional phrase in Christ. Being in Christ is the theme of the New Testament. Like Adam, we were created to be in union with God. But Adam sinned and his union with God, and ours as well, was severed. It is God's eternal plan to bring human creation back to Himself and restore the union He enjoyed with Adam at creation. That restored union with God, which we find in Christ, is the essence of our identity.  When you were born again, your soul was united with God and you came alive spiritually, as alive as Adam was in the garden before he sinned. As the New Testament repeatedly declares, you are now in Christ, and Christ is in you. Since Christ who is in you is eternal, the spiritual life you have received from Him is eternal. You don't have to wait until you die to get eternal life; you possess it right now!  The apostle John wrote, "He who has the Son has the life" (1 John 5:12). He probably remembered Jesus' statement to Martha: "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die" (John 11:25, 26). After Jesus said this to Martha, He added, "Do you believe this?" (verse 26).  The Word of God is clear: Because of Jesus, we will continue to live spiritually even after we die physically. Do you believe this?  Dear Father, I declare my wholehearted belief that my spiritual life--eternal life--is in You. Help me live today with eternity's values in view.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Neil Anderson at < http://www.ficm.org >.

The next five questions to ask yourself regarding God's will are to help you when facing a change in direction.    1 Is it reasonable? God expects us to think. His guidance may     transcend human reasoning, but it never excludes it. God     doesn't bypass our mind; He operates through it: "Brethren,     do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be babes,     but in your thinking be mature" (1 Corinthians 14:20). We are     warned in Scripture not to put our mind in neutral. We are to     think and practice what we know to be true (Philippians 4:8,     9).    2 Does a realistic opportunity exist? Closed doors are not     meant to be knocked down. If you have a hopeless scheme, let     it go. If it isn't God's timing, wait. If a realistic     opportunity exists, and all the other factors are in     agreement, then take the plunge. God may open a window of     opportunity, but it will close if not taken advantage of. The     faithless man asks, "What do I stand to lose if I do?" The     faithful man asks, "What do I risk losing if I don't?"    3 Are unbiased, spiritually sensitive associates in agreement?     Be careful not to consult only those who will agree with you.     Give your advisors permission to ask hard questions. Don't be     afraid of "no" answers. If it isn't God's will, don't you     want to know before you make the mistake of acting     impulsively?    4 Do I have a sanctified desire? Don't think that being in the     will of God must always be an unpleasant task. The joy of the     Lord should be our strength. I find my greatest joy in     serving God and being in His will. But don't get the idea     that if everything is wonderful, you must be in the will of     God. Is this a desire to satisfy a lust of the flesh or a     Spirit-filled desire to see God's kingdom established and     people helped?    5 Do I have a peace about it? This is an inner peace. Is the     peace of God guarding your heart and mind?  If you have been able to answer yes to all 10 of these deciding factors, what are you waiting for?  Thank You, Lord, that I can trust You with the details and direction of my life today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Lydia is a middle-aged woman who was dealt a bad hand in life right from the beginning. Memories of ritual and sexual abuse that she suffered as a young child have haunted her continually throughout her Christian life. When she came to see me, her damaged self-image seemed beyond repair. As she told me her story, Lydia displayed little emotion, but her words reflected total despair.  When she concluded, I asked, "Who are you, Lydia? How do you perceive yourself?"  "I'm evil," she answered stoically. "I'm just no good for anybody. People tell me I'm evil and all I do is bring trouble."  "You're not evil," I argued. "How can a child of God be evil? Is that how you perceive yourself?" Lydia nodded.  It is never pleasant to see the evil one express his ugly personality through a victim like Lydia. But realizing that she is primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross instead of the victim of her past, she was able to throw off the chains of spiritual bondage and begin living according to her true identity as a child of God.  Nothing is more foundational to your freedom from Satan's bondage than understanding and affirming what God has done for you in Christ and who you are as a result. We all live in accordance with our perceived identity. In fact, we cannot consistently behave in a way that is inconsistent with how we perceive ourselves. Your attitudes, actions, responses and reactions to life's circumstances are often determined by your conscious and subconscious self-perception. If you see yourself as the helpless victim of Satan and his schemes, you will live like his victim and be in bondage to his lies. But if you see yourself as the dearly loved and accepted child of God that you really are, you will more likely live like a child of God.  Thank You, Jesus, that You have made me more than a conqueror. Because of Your love and power, I can live as a victor instead of a victim today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Rival 		  01/13/2002 Dow Jones News Services (Copyright © 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     By Ken Brown    Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. "I've missed too many soccer games over the years," he told his brother Tom soon after he quit.   But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival.   A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is "way out of the ballpark" on the high side.   The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. "There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on," Ms. Leone says.   As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month.   But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to "cover" the bet at a sky-high cost.   As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment.   AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. "Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make," says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman.   Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was "absolutely not" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says.   AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company.   The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, "we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down," says the person familiar with the trade.   At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal.   At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices.   His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million.   Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the "first and only time" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. "If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't," Ms. Leone says.   Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the "brokerage window," which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced.   Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year "because of these incredible analyst reviews" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. "Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock," he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska.   He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. "You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing," Tom Skilling says. "There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state."

Here are 12 simple steps you can use to walk through the process of forgiving someone who hurt you in the past.    1 Ask the Lord to reveal the names of the persons who offended     you and the specific wrongs you suffered.    2 Face the hurt and the hate. If you are going to forgive from     your heart, you must let God search the depths of your heart.    3 Acknowledge the significance of the cross. It is the cross of     Christ that makes forgiveness legally and morally right.    4 Decide that you will not retaliate by using the information     about the offender's sin against them (Luke 6:27-34).   5 Decide to forgive. Forgiveness is a conscious choice to let     the other person off the hook and free yourself from the     past.    6 Take your list of names to God and pray the following: "I     forgive ___(name)___ for ___(specifically identify every     remembered pain)__."    7 Destroy the list. You are now free. Do not tell the offenders     what you have done. Your forgiveness is between you and God     unless the offenders have asked you for forgiveness.    8 Do not expect that your decision to forgive will result in     major changes in the other persons. Instead, pray for them     (Matthew 5:44).    9 Try to understand the people you have forgiven. They are     victims also.    10Freedom is a result of forgiveness in you. In time you will     be able to think about the people who offended you without     feeling hurt or anger.    11Thank God for the lessons you have learned and the maturity     you have gained.    12When appropriate, accept your part of the blame for the     offenses you suffered. Confess your failure to God and to     others (1 John 1:9) and realize that if someone has something     against you, you must go to that person (Matthew 5:23-26).  Lord, teach me how to love unconditionally and forgive quickly those who hate me, curse me or mistreat me.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Perhaps you have heard the illustration of the two dogs. Some people say that we have two natures within us vying for control of our lives. They claim that our old sin nature, which we inherited from disobedient Adam, is like a big black dog. Our new nature, which we inherited through Christ's redemptive work, is like a big white dog. These two dogs are bitter enemies, intent on destroying each other. Whenever you involve yourself in worldly thoughts or behavior, you are feeding the black dog. Whenever you focus your mind and activities on spiritual things, you are feeding the white dog. The dog you feed the most will eventually grow stronger and overpower the other.  This dramatic illustration may motivate Christians toward saintly behavior, but is it accurate based on who we really are in Christ? Since God "delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son" (Colossians 1:13), can we still be in both kingdoms? When God declares that we are "not in the flesh but in the Spirit" (Romans 8:9), can we be in the flesh and in the Spirit simultaneously? When God says that "you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord" (Ephesians 5:8), can you possibly be both light and darkness? When God states that "if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come" (2 Corinthians 5:17), can we be partly new creature and partly old creature?  But be careful. Can a Christian sin? Of course! "If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8). But having sin and being sin are two completely different issues. When we choose to walk by the flesh we will sin, but, as 1 John 2:1 reminds us, we don't have to: "My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin."  We will spend the next few days exploring the scriptural bases for this truth.  How liberating to know today, Lord, that I am in the light, that I am a new creature, and that my new nature is firmly anchored in Your work of reconciliation.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

He saw the bondage and the injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40 years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a deliverer.  Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done. This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to reign supreme in the process.  Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may save yourself a trip to the desert.

What is the point of troubled times in our lives? What is God trying to do? What is He trying to teach us? Peter wrote, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation" (1 Peter 4:12, 13).  In God's ministry of testing, we learn a lot about ourselves. Whatever is left of simplistic advice such as "Read your Bible" or "Just work harder" or "Pray more" gets stripped away. Most people going through testing times would love to resolve the crisis, but they seemingly can't and don't know why.  In God's ministry of darkness we learn compassion. We learn to wait patiently with people. We learn to respond to the emotional needs of people who have lost hope. We weep with those who weep. We don't try to teach or instruct or advise. If God took away every external blessing and reduced our assets to nothing more than meaningful relationships, would that be enough to sustain us? Yes, I believe it would.  Perhaps God brings us to the end of our resources so we can discover the vastness of His. We don't hear many sermons about brokenness in our churches these days, yet in all four Gospels Jesus taught us to deny ourselves, pick up our cross daily, and follow Him. I don't know any painless way to die to ourselves, but I do know that it's necessary and that it's the best possible thing that could ever happen to us.  "No pain, no gain," says the body builder. Isn't that true in the spiritual realm as well (Hebrews 12:11)? Proven character comes from persevering through the tribulations of life (Romans 5:3-5). Every great period of personal growth in my life and ministry has been preceded by a major time of testing.  Lord, I submit to Your testing so I may come to the end of my resources and joyfully discover Yours.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

MILITARY RESALE GROUP as BCTL, a public company, now has greater access to capital. MILITARY RESALE GROUP last week announced they have increased their space 3 times. Watch for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.  Military Market Segment Is Hot.   MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS PRODUCT LINE  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid industry, has been added to its product supplier network.  Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000 annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.  President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group is pleased and complimented to have become able to represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our distribution activities. We have previously forecast that we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000 to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new presence is expected to make a major contribution to this $1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''  Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were $750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now a publicly owned company as a result of its recent acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).  The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market, with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The competitive structure of the Military Resale Market consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post- acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by internal growth.

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world. - (John 16:33)   "Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to be true?" This was the comment from a business associate recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)  It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.  Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and ineffective.  Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.     ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Os Hillman, president of Marketplace Leaders, located in Atlanta, GA.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel     RTO Week  Day 2 -- October 16, 2001  Congestion Management and Transmission Rights  The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.  General Observations  The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.      Locational Marginal Pricing  The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.    FTRs versus Flowgates  The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.  The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.  FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.    The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.  Options versus Obligations  The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.    The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.    Let me know if you have any questions.

TJ and Claudette--Please forward to your groups.  Thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Rodriquez, Andy  Sent: Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:46 PM  Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />  Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.   General Observations   The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions.    FERC Deliverables  A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.    The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.  The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.  The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.    One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:   ·         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?   ·         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are allowed)?    ·         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?   ·         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?   ·         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?   ·         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?   ·         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?   ·         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?   Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financial hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.  Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.   NERC and GISB   A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.  Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.  Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.  There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.  The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.  Let me know if you have any questions.

No longer will we see getting up early and staying up late as God's way. Living in the Promised Land in business means we know that God is the source of our provision and that our work is an act of worship to Him. Provision is a by-product, not an end in itself. Work is no longer something that must be sweated and toiled upon to make ends meet. "Could this really be true?" you might be saying. God has made it clear that obedience is the assurance of provision. Whenever we go beyond the normal workday due to fear of non-provision, we are operating in unbelief. We are saying that it is up to us to make things happen. Sure, there are times when we work longer hours due to a deadline, but we must be sure the motive is not out of fear of loss or fear of non-provision. If we are obedient to what God has called us to, He will provide our every need. This can be a hard lesson for goal-oriented businesspeople.  I recall coming into this understanding. I had been a workaholic. Long hours were common. Then God shook up my world and I was challenged by a friend to examine my motives for working long hours. I realized the source of those long hours was fear. Once I came into this understanding, I refused to work long hours even though the natural man would tell me I'd never make things happen if I worked a normal work week. Again, this reasoning is based on a lack of faith. If we are obedient to what God has called each of us to, we will not lack. At times it may be less than what we might like; at other times it may be more than we deserve. These are God's ways.  The Bible tells us to come out of Babylon. Babylon is a system of work and philosophy that is contrary to God's ways. Are you operating in any aspect of work from a Babylonian value system? Ask the Lord to reveal this to you. Begin to walk in the freedom He has given us in our work life.       Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

You have no control over a primary emotion, developed in the past, when it is triggered. It doesn't do any good to feel guilty about something over which you have no control. But you can seek to resolve the past conflict and you can immediately evaluate the present circumstance to bring it into perspective. For example, suppose you meet a man named Bill. He looks like the Bill who used to beat you up as a child. Even though he's not the same person, your primary emotion initially jumps to a 3 on a scale of 10. But you mentally tell yourself that this is not the same Bill, and you think yourself down to a 2.  You have not only used this process yourself thousands of times, but you have also helped others do it. Someone flies off the handle, so you grab him and tell him to get hold of himself. You are helping that person gain control of himself by making him think. Notice how this works the next time you're watching a football game and tempers explode on the field. One player grabs an enraged teammate and says, "Listen, Meathead, you're going to cost us a 15-yard penalty and perhaps the game if you don't simmer down." The player will see the conflict in perspective and will get himself under control by thinking clearly.  Some Christians assert that the past isn't important. If you're talking about truth, then I would agree. The truth is truth--past, present and future. But if you are talking about what people are actually experiencing, I would have to disagree. Most of the people who argue that the past isn't important have major unresolved conflicts from the past which they are not allowing to surface. They are attempting to handle themselves by living in denial. Either that or they are extremely fortunate to have a conflict-free past. Those who have had major traumas and have learned to resolve them in Christ know how devastating the past can be to present reality.  Lord, I choose not to live in denial. Give me the grace to look at my past and the courage to face the truth.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

While Christians have been questioning the reality of demonic influence in the church, the world has charged into the spiritual realm with reckless abandon. The Western world is experiencing a massive paradigm shift in its worldview, as best seen in the rise of the New Age Movement, the acceptance of parapsychology as a science, the growing popularity of the supernatural, and the increasing visibility of Satanism in our culture. New Age mysticism, which gathered its greatest strength with the influx of Eastern religions in the 1960s, has been popularized by a host of celebrities in the 1980s. It's commonplace to hear channelers (mediums) on radio and TV talk shows boasting about their spirit guides (demons).  But the New Age Movement is not just a celebrity issue. New Age philosophy is making significant inroads into business, education and even religion across our nation. Recently I challenged two my students to attend, for the sake of research, a New Age conference being held two blocks from our school. When they arrived at the door and discovered the cost to be $65 each, they started to walk away. But two strangers approached them saying, "We were told to give you these tickets." My wide-eyed students took the tickets and walked in.  They reported to me that one of the speakers led conference participants in a meditation exercise. He challenged everyone to imagine a spirit guide coming alongside. The speaker concluded the exercise by saying, "Now invite your spirit guide to come in." I could hardly believe it. The devil is giving altar calls just two blocks from Biola University!  Does the spread of New Age and the occult worry you or frighten you? It need not. In Christ you have every resource to defuse and dispel any threat of darkness in your life or family. Stand on the truth of His Word and walk in the light of your identity in Christ.  Keep me alert today, Lord, to inroads the devil is attempting in my world that I may tear down his strongholds with the weapons of the Spirit.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Planning & Expansion X-SDOC: 778266 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-315.eml          RTO Week Day 2 -- October 16, 2001 Transmission Planning & Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron. General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.   Opening Statements Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.   Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered. Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process. Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.   Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?   Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters. Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.   Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties. Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "tweaks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal. In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you (John 14:27).  Peace on earth--that's what everybody wants. But nobody can guarantee external peace because nobody can control other people or circumstances. Nations sign and break peace treaties with frightening regularity. Couples lament that there would be peace in their home "if only he/she would shape up." No one can guarantee peace at home or on the job site. However, we should always strive to be peacemakers. Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God" (Matthew 5:9). Paul instructed, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men" (Romans 12:18).  But let's face it: Peace with others isn't always possible, because peace doesn't just depend on us. Peace on earth is what we want; peace with God is what we have; the peace of God is what we need.  Peace with God is something you already have (Romans 5:1). It's not something you strive for; it's something you received when you were born again. The Prince of Peace reconciled you to God by shedding His own blood.  The peace of God is something you need to appropriate daily in your inner world in the midst of the storms which rage in the external world (John 14:27). There are a lot of things that can disrupt your external world because you can't control all your circumstances and relationships. But you can control the inner world of your thoughts by allowing the peace of Christ to rule in your heart on a daily basis (Colossians 3:15). There may be chaos all around you, but God is bigger than any storm. I keep a little plaque on my desk which reminds me: "Nothing will happen to me today that God and I cannot resolve."  The peace of Christ will rule in your heart when you "let the word of Christ richly dwell within you" (Colossians 3:16). And when you turn to Him in prayer, "the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:7).  Prince of Peace, rule in my heart today. Give me Your peace and make me a peacemaker in all my relationships.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts (Romans 6:11, 12).  Sin is the condition into which all descendants of fallen Adam are born (Romans 5:12). Sin is living our lives independently of God. It's the result of being deceived by Satan to believe that meaning and purpose in life may be achieved apart from a personal relationship with, and obedience to, the Creator of life (Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; 1 John 5:12). In the non-Christian, sin permeates the old nature, dominates the old self, and perpetuates the deeds of the flesh. Satan is at the heart of all sin (1 John 3:8). He deceives people into believing a lie and counsels them to rebel against God.  When you received Christ you died to sin and its power to dominate you was broken. Satan and sin have not died; they are still strong and appealing. But you no longer have to sin because you are dead to sin and alive to God in Christ (Romans 6:11). You are not dead to sin because you consider it so; you consider it so because it is so. In Christ you have already died to sin.  Paul goes on to say that we are not to use our bodies as instruments of unrighteousness (verse 13). If we do, we allow sin to rule in our mortal bodies. For example, it is virtually impossible for someone to commit a sexual sin and not use his body as an instrument of unrighteousness, allowing sin to rule. Ask the Lord to reveal to your mind how you have wrongly used your body, especially sexually. Renounce that wrong use and then submit your body to God as a living sacrifice. It is your responsibility not to let "sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts" (Romans 6:12).  Loving Lord, I know that sin's power over me has been broken.

Symbol: MERH Shares Outstanding: 13.2 million Share Price: $1.90 Market Capitalization: $25 million 52 Week Hi/Low: $8.50/$0.45 Estimated Public Float: 2 million shares  Developed over the last four years, Merilus has recently started marketing the latest and most advanced computer security products targeted for small to medium businesses.   This market has been, and is projected to be, one of the fastest sectors in technology, largely unaffected by the current weakness in the market.      THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY A Computer Security Institute and FBI survey showed 90% of large organizations detected breaches into their computing systems.  74% of these organizations acknowledged financial losses.  Price Waterhouse estimated this loss to be about $40 billion last year.  The estimated number of computer attacks doubled last year according to the Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University.  International Data Corp. (IDC) predicts the compounded annual growth rates of digital security revenues will continue at over 88% per year over the next 5 years.    Merilus' products target small to medium businesses, a particularly fast growing segment of the overall security market, which has been underserved by the major security manufacturers.  IDC estimates the small to medium business percentage of the total internet security software market will increase from the current 43% to about 70% by 2004. In terms of dollars, this means companies with fewer than 1000 employees could spend about $7.4 billion on security in 2004.  We strongly feel Merilus is focusing on the right market, at the right time.   MERILUS SOLUTIONS Merilus' computer software and hardware products represent major innovations, which protect against computer information theft from hackers and others both outside and within the business.  Their recently introduced FireCards are the world's first network security system and firewall (controlling who can access what type of data) that easily inserts into the standard PCI slot inside the computer. It is a computer within the computer allowing for remote updating of new innovations and security measures to ensure sensitive data is protected as well as transmitted in a secure manner.   Industry reviews have given the new products high ratings.  Secure Computing Magazine gave the FireCard a five out of five star rating and The Tech Zone awarded a 9.5 out of 10 score.  NASA and Lockheed Martin are just a couple of the sophisticated organizations that have started using Merilus products.  Even though Merilus and its products are relatively new to the market place we feel they will also have good acceptance because they are extremely price competitive.  Management will strive to maintain its current 2:1 cost/feature ratio, where products are either half the price of competitors for the same functionality or twice the functionality for the same price.  Manufacturing of the products is contracted out to keep capital and inventory costs down and flexibility up.   THE ROLLOUT Over the summer, after rigorous testing in Compaq's labs, Merilus has become a member of the Compaq Solutions Alliance, allowing installation of products into Compaq computers. Merilus recently announced they have partnered with the three largest distributors in North America: Ingram Micro, Tech Data and EMJ.  Last week Merilus announced its Reseller Program, which provides marketing and technical support as well as substantial rebates to vendors selling Merilus' suite of computer security products.   MANAGEMENT Dana Epp, President of Merilus started writing commercial security monitoring software at the age of 14 and authored the book Computer Security Concepts, Managing Business Threats in a Wired World.  Merilus has attracted a number of credible and notable Board members such as John Connally, son of the former US Treasury Secretary, John Paul DeJoria, Chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems.   FINANCIALS and PROJECTIONS Two companies established in this industry are SonicWall (SNWL) and Watchguard Technologies (WGRD).  Over the last couple of years these two companies have enjoyed approximately 100% annualized revenue growth.  Analyst's consensus (Thompson Financial) is that they will have sales growth next year of about 50% and 40%, respectively. Merilus is in the process of raising $3 million in a Private Placement to power its marketing initiatives, increase inventory and to strengthen its balance sheet.  Management and its financiers expect to close this needed funding before year-end. Currently the Company has minimal, but rapidly increasing revenues.    Management is estimating revenues of $8 million next year increasing to $34 million in 2003.  In 2003 they estimate achieving net income of roughly $4 million.  By 2003, we estimate the shares outstanding could increase to about 18 million.  If these numbers were met and a price to earnings ratio of 30 was applied, it could suggest a possible $6 share price.  Management's latest estimates are for revenues increasing to $93 million in 2004.  Merilus is little known in investment circles however an Investor Awareness Program is expected to start next week.

I am learning about pastors and missionaries across the country who are preaching against the very sins they are committing themselves. Nationally known Christian personalities who vehemently condemn immorality have themselves been found to be hiding an immoral lifestyle. Those of us who are called to preach or teach God's Word must put it on first. We must get on our knees before God as we prepare the message and say, "God, is this Scripture true in my life?" If not, we had better be honest enough to say to those who hear us, "I wish I were a better example of this passage than I am, but I'm still growing in this area." To proclaim the Word of God as if it were true in your life when it's not is a lie.  Those of us who receive the Word are also vulnerable to self-deception if we fail to put it into practice. We hear a sermon or a lesson and say, "Wow! What a great truth!! and hurry off to share it with someone else without processing it ourselves and applying it to our own lives. James said that hearers of the Word who are not also doers of the Word deceive themselves.  Why are we afraid to admit it when our lives don't completely match up to Scripture? I believe it's because many of us have a perfection complex. We think we have to model perfection and not admit to something less. But we can't model perfection, because we're not perfect; we can only model growth. The people around us need to know that we are real people in the process of maturing. They need to see how we handle failure as well as how we handle success. When we model this kind of honesty in the Christian community, we greatly reduce the possibility of the deceiver gaining a foothold.  Lord, forgive me for the times I have placed the quest for earthly perfection ahead of growth in You and Your Word. Help me model growth in my life today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.  It is written by Neil Anderson at < http://www.ficm.org >.

The old structuring  model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created  this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found  the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five  strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our  markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our  competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a  complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are  trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and  will eventually have them on a daily basis.  You will need special permission to access the files located in  M:\power2\Options.

You neglected the Rock who begot you, and forgot the God who gave you birth (Deuteronomy 32:17, 18).  The New Age Movement cloaks the occult in the description of New Age enlightenment: "You don't need God; you are God. You don't need to repent of your sins and depend on God to save you. Sin isn't a problem; you just need to turn off your mind and tune in to the great cosmic oneness through harmonic convergence." The New Age pitch is the oldest lie of Satan: "You will be like God" (Genesis 3:5).  This thirst for knowledge and power has lured a fallen humanity to seek guidance from mediums and spiritists, and from such occultic practices as fortune-telling, tarot cards, palm-reading, Ouija boards, astrology, magic charming and automatic writing. People all around us are ignoring the God who loves them and wants to guide their lives and are instead seeking light and peace in the kingdom of darkness. Peace can only be found in the Prince of Peace, not in the prince of darkness.  Don't be carried away by the prospect of knowledge and power which is luring so many people in our culture today away from God. People such as the devotees of Simon in Acts 8:9, 10, will continue to be astonished by those who practice New Age sorcery. Others, such as the customers of the demon-possessed slave girl in Acts 16:16-18, will contribute to the profit of those who exercise a spirit of divination. As in these examples from the early church, those who seek knowledge and power from the dark side will greatly interfere with the work of God, deceiving many by the counterfeit forces they employ. Other people will thirst after power to such an extent that they will sacrifice to the "goat demons" (Leviticus 17:7) and even sacrifice their own children to demons (Psalm 106:36-38).  Let the words of Deuteronomy 32:17, 18, sober us to the reality that even believers are vulnerable to being lured away from the knowledge and power of God by our enemy.  Lord, I refuse to participate with the powers of darkness. You are my life and the light of my world.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results.   	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.  	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.  	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

When we first became Christians, we were like one-third horsepower lawn mower engines. We could accomplish something, but not very much because we weren't very mature. Our ambition as Christians is to become engines that can power earth-moving machinery--real powerhouses for the Lord. But neither a lawn mower nor a bulldozer can accomplish anything without gas. And neither can we accomplish anything apart from Christ (John 15:5). No matter how mature you are, you can never be productive unless you are walking in the Spirit.  When it comes to the choice between walking according to the flesh and walking according to the Spirit, our will is like a toggle switch. The new Christian's will seems to be spring-loaded toward fleshly behavior. He is still the unwitting victim of a thoroughly trained flesh which only knows how to operate independently of God. The mature Christian's will is spring-loaded toward the Spirit. He makes occasional poor choices, but he is learning to crucify the flesh and walk in the Spirit on a daily basis.  If you re hoping for a magic formula or a list of foolproof steps for walking in the Spirit, you will be disappointed. The moment you reduce the Spirit-filled walk to a formula or an intellectual exercise, you probably won't be Spirit-filled anymore.  The Holy Spirit is a "He," not an "it." Our walk with God is a personal experience, not a mechanical or legalistic formula. We see the immorality of fleshly indulgence everywhere, but simply preaching against it and telling people to shape up is not God's answer. The law is powerless to give life (Galatians 3:21). Reintroducing the law to believers won't work. But if we learn to walk by the Spirit, we won't carry out the desires of the flesh. Let's encourage others to do the same.  Lord, I desire to be patient with others in their walk of faith as You are patient with me. Help me have a gracious response and a gentle answer to others today.   ----------- This daily devotional is published and distributed by Crosswalk.com.

Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 16:25:35 +0200 (CEST) Subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results From: Office of the Chairman-@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Office+20of+20the+20Chairman-+40ENRON@ENRON.com> To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-All+20Enron+20Worldwide+40ENRON@ENRON.com> X-SDOC: 778291 X-ZLID: zl-edrm-enron-v2-king-j-340.eml   Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.  We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.  Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.  Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.  Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.   Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.  Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.  Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.  In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include: ·	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ·	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ·	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.    With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.
