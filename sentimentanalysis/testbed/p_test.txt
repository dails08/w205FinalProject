Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.  The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.  Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as "a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."  Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."  To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.  "Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.  The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35¢/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4¢/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25¢/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30¢/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32¢/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Tycholiz, Barry   Sent:	Friday, October 26, 2001 7:44 AM To:	Whitt, Mark Subject:	FW: Resume - Confidential  Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week, attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that model...
