 the greatest good we can do for others is not to share our riches with them, but to reveal their own. - author unknown one should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. the most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community. -- albert einstein we must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment. -- jim rohn the game of life is a game of boomerangs. our thoughts, deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy. -- florence scovel shinn "

 diane, i apologize for getting this to you so late. i should have no staffing additions next year. staff manager 1 sr. 2 average to high training both seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (effective communication) and 1 technical class. i think that everything else should roll for next year. let me know what else i need to give you. d diane h cook 09/14/2000 03:12 pm to: robert katherine l michael pat rita steve dutch jeffrey c kam william darron c daren j david jefferson d bryce mary m lisa cc: bob m steve leslie subject: budget help!! salaries, salaries, salaries!!! everyone is having problems. unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is. i have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels. i have asked the hr department to also give me the low and the high. let's face it - your staff today and their salary most likely are not what they are going to be next year! to much movement of people. so using estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels. here's what you can do: 1) make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) then put down if you think i should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. you can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc. 3) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) here is the average: sr. $4,961 spec $3,964 staff $3,026 sr. clrk $2,548 clerk $2,264 asst $3,162 your list would look something like this: assistant average clerk very high sr. clerk low specialist low to average specialist average sr. specialist average to high analyst (they are all allocated at the same amount) you can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them. it's up to you. next item - training!!! here's what you can do: 1) list your staff and the type of class they need 2) if you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what type of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. time management) or technical (derivatives or applied finance or wellhead to burnertip) 3) the personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) the technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) just list the type of class, and i'll do the rest. next item - headhunters! try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees. other stuff - i have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts). if you forget these items, i will make sure it is added to your budget. once i put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.hopefully this helps you some. diane x-37059 "

in the united states of america federal energy regulatory commission el paso natural gas company å_ docket no. cp00-422-001 å_ å_ motion of enron north america corp. for leave to intervene and comments in support pursuant to rule 214 of the federal energy regulatory commission's (‰ÛÏcommission‰Ûù) rules of practice and procedure, 18 c.f.r. å_385.214, enron north america corp. (ena) hereby respectfully moves for leave to intervene in support in the above-captioned proceeding. in support hereof, ena states as follows: i. the names, titles, and mailing addresses of the persons to whom correspondence and communications concerning this proceeding are to be sent are as follows: leslie j. lawner *rebecca cantrell attorney for director, federal regulatory affairs enron north america corp. enron north america corp. 712 n. lea p. o. box 1188 roswell, new mexico 88201 houston, texas 77251-1188 (505) 623-6778 (713) 853-5840 fax (505) 625-2820 fax (713) 646-5785 *designated for service in accordance with rule 203, 18 c.f.r. å_385.203, of the commission‰Ûªs rules of practice and procedure. ii. ena is comprised of a number of companies which are subsidiaries of enron corp. in the natural gas industry, ena's activities include buying and selling natural gas in north america, providing a broad array of services to gas producers, offering price hedging and risk management services to gas buyers and sellers, and offering producers and other market participants various financing options. ena is one of the largest marketers of natural gas in the united states. iii. on march 15, 2001, el paso natural gas company (‰ÛÏel paso‰Ûù) filed an amendment to the pending application for its line 2000 project filed in docket no. cp00-422-000. el paso requests that the commission (1) issue an order by march 31, 2001, permitting el paso to initiate the cleaning and modification of its line 2000, (2) delete the portion of the application to abandon the six existing mainline compressor facilities, and (3) authorize by april 15, 2001, the proposal to expand the design capacity of el paso‰Ûªs system by approximately 230,000 mcf per day. el paso states that the requested authority will facilitate an in-service date of august 31, 2001, which will enable el paso to place the expansion into service in time to help ameliorate the california energy crisis this year. el paso also states that it will place the line 2000 project in service as a loop to the existing system and will continue to operate the existing south system compression without additional contracts to cover its operating and investment costs. ena supports el paso‰Ûªs amended application. el paso states that, as soon as the line 2000 project is placed into service, it will begin including the 230,000 mcf per day of incremental capacity in the daily scheduling of gas on its system. this will serve to reduce daily allocations of capacity and provide greater flexibility for shippers on the south system. of perhaps greater importance is the need to offset reductions in capacity that could result from the testing that will be conducted during the remainder of the year in compliance with an office of pipeline safety corrective action order. iv. as a shipper and marketer of natural gas, the ena companies have an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome in these proceedings. moreover, ena‰Ûªs interests cannot be adequately represented by any other party to these proceedings, and ena‰Ûªs participation in these proceedings will be in the public interest. wherefore, for the reasons set forth herein, ena respectfully moves to intervene in the above-captioned proceeding, requests that it be accorded all rights as a full party to such proceeding, and requests that the commission expeditiously approve el paso‰Ûªs amended application. respectfully submitted, leslie j. lawner attorney for enron north america corp. 712 n. lea roswell, new mexico 88201 (505) 623-6778 dated: march 29, 2001 certificate of service i, leslie j. lawner, hereby certify that i have caused a copy of the foregoing document to be served upon the secretary of the commission in accordance with the requirements of rule 2010 of the rules of practice and procedure. dated this 29th day of march 2001. leslie j. lawner "

 brad, i got a better picture of the delay issue when i talked to keith this morning. apparently, his group has lost their server liscence. as a consequence they cannot access their materials. keith is doing everything he can that does not require the server, and when they regain access, we will get the map out asap. in the mean time, i am looking into major interconnects as well as storage facilities. as of now, i don't have a precise timeline on when the server issue will be resolved. when it occurs, i'll let you know. thanks adam "

 thanks, rosie...that's what i suspected. by the way, i spoke to senator gramm's staff today who confirmed that senator gramm also said he would oppose it. interesting that sometimes people hear what they want to hear, isn't it. kenneth lay on 09/11/2000 07:23:51 am sent by: rosalee fleming to: cynthia cc: steven j richard james d joe tom joe sarah subject: re: new puhca exemption legislative language cynthia, ken said to tell you that he told david sokol we would probably oppose it. rosie cynthia sandherr 09/08/2000 04:49 pm to: kenneth steven j richard james d joe tom joe sarah cc: subject: new puhca exemption legislative language yesterday, ken lay spoke with midamerican ceo david sokol regarding the attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited puhca exemption for companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by independent market analysts (i.e. a rating for holding companies or investment grade rating for utility companies). this is not a permanent exemption as puhca would again apply should the company loose its high rating. midamerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with ken lay's reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could. reportedly, ken lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed. the utility strategy is to have senator bob kerrey (d-ne) offer this as an amendment to a must pass piece of legislation during the waning days of this congressional session. this will be separate from the utilities' strategy to enact private use legislation (h.r. 4971, s. 2967 which includes tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily for commonwealth edison) and to enact stand-alone reliability legislation (s. 2071 and h.r. 2944). senator kerrey has already spoken to senator gramm (r-tx) about this puhca amendment and gramm was reportedly non-committal but not negatively disposed to the idea. i will follow-up with gramm's staff next week after they've reviewed it and convey their views to you. according to midamerican, the concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was senator kerrey's idea. it is possible that congressman dingell (d-mi) and congressman markey (d-ma) would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact that congressman dingell (who would chair the commerce committee should the democrats regain control of the house) has recently said that whether or not he is commerce committee chairman next congress, that comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation including puhca repeal is at least three years away from happening. steve and rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position on this amendment? as a reminder, enron's position here-to-date has been to oppose stand-alone puhca repeal as this is the one provision utilities like southern company really want. to date, this strategy has worked with the midamerican utility group willing to support our transmission open access provisions in turn for our puhca exemption support.

jeff pearson, ruth concannon, martin cuilla, geoff storey, michael cowan, chris lambie subject: s&p statement of principles x-sdoc: 719001 x-zlid: zl-edrm-enron-v2-storey-g-1089.eml attached is the agreement in principle reached today between tcpl and its stakeholders on terms tcpl is prepared to bring to the board if there is broad enough industry support. the following are the key changes from the draft distributed on monday feb 12. discretionary revenue sharing to tcpl subject to cap of $5m (from $7.5m) with higher sharing percentages by revenue class. aos of 4% (from 2.5%) of ft demand charge paid as credit to it invoice. 4% is approx 240 mmcfd. it floor to be railed between 80% and 120% of ft toll but floating monthly with marginal fuel cost. there are two very controversial elements that may cause some parties to litigate. tcpl has slipped in the severance costs for 200 employees that were laid off in dec 2000 but technically terminated in 2001. at $100k per employee this works out to $20 m or about one cent on the eastern zone toll. tcpl is also not willing to consider liquidating this year any of their 8 bcf of storage working gas and are not even conceding that the gas belongs to the shippers. speculation is they have arbed much of it this winter and are trying to pocket all of the upside with no benefit to the shippers who paid for it. if tcpl proceeds with this agreement without opposition then there will be a cost of capital hearing to set the roe and capital structure. if they don't then there will be a lengthy rate hearing where many time consuming issues such as higher depreciation will be debated. if tcpl proceeds with this deal in the face of litigants (from the ldcs perhaps) it is unclear which issues will be raised or how long the hearing will take. tcpl is requesting by close of business tuesday that we indicate whether we will either a. sign the agreement or b. neither sign nor litigate or c. litigate to neb. i understand from discussion earlier this week with jon mckay and rob milnthorp that enron will choose option b. we can review on tuesday. if anybody wants clarification on anything let me know. kevin "

 to: ken lay from: mike wood cc: john l. garrison, amanda martin date: october 18, 2000 subject: azurix/city of houston project confidential the city of houston's northeast water purification plant (‰ÛÏnewpp‰Ûù)project is proceeding under the direction of the houston area water corporation (hawc). given your personal involvement and interest in this project, i want to brief you on the following recent developments: project defined by public works: ch2mhill, in its role as consultant to the city and the hawc, have prepared an 800-page project definition document (pdd). although the document has not yet been made public, public works made a presentation to the hawc at a recent board meeting in which they outlined the project scope, selection process, and proposed terms and conditions contained in the pdd. we have two concerns that are the focus of our current lobbying efforts: 1) the recommended selection criteria includes price as a consideration. our concern is that price will become the sole focus, allowing us filter to deliver on their threat to do whatever it takes to win the project. we believe a qualifications-based selection process, followed by price negotiation would better serve the public; and, 2) the proposed plant capacity is 40 mgd with a firm option for an additional 40 mgd. (it is not at all clear what terms and conditions will apply to the option.) we believe simply establishing the capacity at 80-100 mgd, as we proposed in our submittal last may, is fully justified and in line with the intended goal of addressing regional water needs. azurix presentation well received by the hawc board: at last friday's meeting, the azurix-cdm team and each of three other vendors made 20-minute presentations to the board. at the request of the board, the focus of the presentation was our vision of a regional water system and what approach to the newpp best fits that vision. a major theme of our story was the need for an initial plant capacity of 80-100 mgd in order to serve the near-term demand of muds located just north of the city limits. questions from the board, particularly chairman david berg, suggest they are not inclined to increase the capacity without definitive assurance that doing so is a risk-free proposition for the city and the hawc. we emphasized our intent to structure the transaction to accomplish that, but doing so prior to contract award is not feasible. we will continue to drive that point over the next week, but the 40 mgd excess capacity will likely remain in the form of an option in the final pdd. informal feedback from public works indicates the azurix presentation was by far the most substantive and informative of the four and was well received by the board. azurix-cdm short-listed: also at last week's meeting, the board unanimously approved the previously announced recommendation of public works to short-list three competing teams: azurix-cdm, us filter, and montgomery-watson. we still believe us filter is our most formidable competitor. in recent weeks, the us filter team has approached us via dannenbaum engineering and made veiled overtures to combining forces. this coincides with conversations, i understand you may have had with jim royers. the ball was left in jim dannenbaum‰Ûªs court last monday and we have not heard anything since. while we do not see us filter adding value to our proposal, especially with the project being downsized, we certainly have not rejected the idea outright. process defined: the hawc board approved the pdd for release to short-listed vendors, subject to any changes the board may choose to make. public works advises us they expect to finalize and release the pdd to short-listed vendors the week of october 23rd. we will then have approximately six weeks to prepare a definitive proposal. the planned timetable still calls for the hawc to award the project by year-end. obviously, a great deal of work still lies ahead. nevertheless, i am encouraged by the events of the past several weeks and believe azurix is well positioned at this point. i will keep you apprised of developments as the process unfolds. in the meantime, please call me at extension 5-5121 should you have any questions or comments.

 awadmail issue 70 march 3, 2002 a weekly compendium of feedback on the words in a.word.a.day and other interesting tidbits about words and languages -------------------------------- from: wordsmith sponsor subject: sponsor of this awadmail issue: maui oma cafe, caffe, kahawa, kohii, kove, coffi, kaffe, kope, kavo, kahvi, koffie, kafe, kaffee - regardless of your linguistic preferences, coffee is a worldwide obsession. get yours direct and fresh roasted from maui oma at http://www.hawaiicoffee.net. -------------------------------- from: anu garg subject: on the horizon... it was on march 14, eight years ago, that a.word.a.day sent its first word. while we observe our octennial next week, it's time for new initiatives. we're considering launching an ad-free, paid subscription service, in addition to continuing the existing free service. details to follow. -------------------------------- from: mike pope subject: re: a.word.a.day--impresario refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/impresario.html the word of the day reminded me of this quote. it's from rossini, the italian composer and apparently a famous procrastinator, reminiscing in a letter on the best time to compose an overture: wait until the evening before opening night. nothing primes inspiration more than necessity, whether it be the presence of a copyist waiting for your work or the prodding of an impresario tearing his hair. in my time, all the impresarios in italy were bald at thirty. -------------------------------- from: janelle forgette subject: impresario in my italian language class, we learned about the customs surrounding funerals, and that the person or company that arranges them is called an impresario. i thought it almost amusing at the time, since we associate that title with the world of entertainment, and i hadn't thought of funerals in that light. thanks to your definition, it now makes complete sense to me, and explains why the english name for the person who arranges funerals is undertaker. that title though is probably being taken over by funeral director - less gloomy sounding, i suppose. but if we're headed in that direction, why not go all the way to impresario and really brighten things up? -------------------------------- from: kenneth l. davis subject: re: buskin refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/buskin.html after too many years, the penny drops: the name of my high school drama club was sock & buskin. i knew it referred to footwear, but the history was never fully explained. many thanks. -------------------------------- from: cheryl la montagne subject: re: a.word.a.day--odeum refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/odeum.html on a recent broadcast of lbc (london) they were having a discussion about why cinemas were called odeon in the uk and one explanation given was that it was an acronym for oscar deutsch entertains our nation. oscar deutsch founded the odeon chain. -------------------------------- from: jeb b. raitt subject: re: a.word.a.day--odeum you wrote: > now you know why so many cinema halls are named odeon. including nickelodeon, was once the name of many theaters, then a music machine. and i can see why the theaters use the greek rather than the latin form. odeum is much too much like odium. -------------------------------- from: roy c kepferle subject: odeum odeum struck a chord in my memory of words to songs: put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon. all i want is loving you, and music, music, music. eight or ten from our colorado high school class of '44 held afternoon impromptu dance sessions at our local cafe to the music of the day from the jukebox (nickelodeon) in the corner. the cost per play then was five cents, equal to the cost of a coca-cola. -------------------------------- from: eric shackle subject: spaghetti western refer: http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0102 many have watched spaghetti westerns, but few have heard of spaghetti bridges. they're described, with amazing grace and five lords a-flipping, in the march issue of my free e-book http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/ebook.htm ............................................................................ there are some that only employ words for the purpose of disguising their thoughts. -voltaire, philosopher (1694-1778) send your comments to to subscribe or unsubscribe a.word.a.day, send a message to with subject line as subscribe <your name> or unsubscribe. archives, faq, gift subscription form, and more at: http://wordsmith.org/awad/ (awad.20020303.385014.001.1015209942) "

 homer - the problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month. as far as i know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month. is that a real issue for us here? we have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month): each calendar month during the term of the transaction will be a determination period; provided that, if the term of the transaction is less than one calendar month, the determination period shall be the term of the transaction. in some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable). that is a commercial call. just let me know how you want to handle that issue. if mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and i will come up with alternative language. mark homer lin 06/01/2001 10:15 am to: mark joe scott cc: carlos robert subject: re: tanker freight long description mark, looks good. the product description looks fine for copying the shipping products that scott moncrieff is trading now in london. i'm a little concerned about the line: each calendar month during the term of the transaction will be a determination period... is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to mid-month? as in june 15 to july 14 to represent a month? or will that just be another long description that we would have to draft for another product type? also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller increments than one month? let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month. may be something like: each calendar month during the term of the transaction will be a determination period unless otherwise specified by the effective dates that's my two cents, homer x57642 from: mark taylor on 05/31/2001 06:25 pm to: joe homer carlos cc: scott robert subject: tanker freight long description here is a draft of the us version. please let me know if it works for you.

 after much success last year with our askwhy advertising campaign and public relations efforts, enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. one approach is through customer relationship marketing (crm), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important cxos and existing customers. to this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the frank gehry architect exhibition at the guggenheim museum in new york city, which will be open to the public from may 18 through august 31. frank gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ode to why commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. with this exhibition, gehry's evolving genius comes to life. for years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. by challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as enron has in business. through enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the leading company in the world. all employees are invited to visit this exhibition free of charge with an enron id badge beginning may 18. for more details, please visit home.enron.com.

the ‰ÛÏgood old days‰Ûù of cost-plus rate regulation were not really as good as some people would like to remember them. in reality, the traditional model produced more waste, less service, fewer innovations and, yes, high prices. conversely, customers across the country have benefited from efficiency gains and a downward trend in electricity prices during the emerging competitive regime that began in the 1980s, according to a new analysis commissioned by the electric power supply association (epsa). for more information and a look at the data contained in the epsa analysis performed by the boston pacific co., please visit www.bostonpacific.com/powerprices, or contact jackie gallagher at (202) 628-8200, cost -plus regulation is a minuscustomersfor power 1401 new york avenue, nw, 11th floor washington, dc 20005 202-628-8200 fax 202-628-8260 www.epsa.org in the introduction to its landmark open-access order no. 888, the federal energy regulatory commission recalls that, during the heavily regulated 70s and early 80s, inflation-adjusted electricity prices increased 25 percent for residential customers and 86 percent for industrial/ commercial customers. that significant increase before 1985 is in sharp contrast to the significant decrease epsa found in inflation-adjusted electricity prices during the subsequent 15-year period, in which the nation began evolving toward a competitive electricity business. this evolution, a customer-driven response to cost overruns and poor performance at large baseload power plants during the 1970s, began with implementation during the early 1980s of the public utilities regulatory policy act, initiating the development of an independent power supply industry. during the 1985-1999 period, inflation-adjusted electricity prices decreased on average by 30 percent for residential customers, 36 percent for industrial/commercial customers and 36 percent for the ‰ÛÏall customers‰Ûù class. moreover, the decreases were widespread. in epsa‰Ûªs sample, 84 percent of the utilities exhibited greater than a 20 percent decrease in inflationadjusted prices for residential customers; 94 percent reported greater than a 20 percent decrease for industrial/commercial customers. while competition isn‰Ûªt the only reason prices fell during this period, it was an important component. for example, the most dramatic price decreases occurred where competitive pressure was the greatest. initially, that pressure was in the industrial/ commercial sector, primarily in the form of on-site cogeneration, which helped lead to a 36 percent reduction versus 30 percent for captive residential customers. similarly, the development of robust competition in wholesale power markets contributed to the 36 percent decline in the ‰ÛÏall customers‰Ûù class, which includes wholesale electricity sales (sales-for-resale). moreover, to the extent price decreases can be attributed to declines in fuel prices, this also can be traced indirectly to competition in other energy businesses. the organization of petroleum exporting countries‰Ûª hold on oil prices was broken as the oil price spikes of the 1970s led to aggressive marketplace responses from both suppliers and consumers. natural gas prices also fell as that business was restructured. 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 ‰Û÷80 ‰Û÷81 ‰Û÷82 ‰Û÷83 ‰Û÷84 ‰Û÷85 ‰Û÷86 ‰Û÷87 ‰Û÷88 ‰Û÷89 ‰Û÷90 ‰Û÷91 ‰Û÷92 ‰Û÷93 ‰Û÷94 ‰Û÷95 ‰Û÷96 ‰Û÷97 ‰Û÷98 ‰Û÷99 summary of results 1980-‰Ûª99 1985-‰Ûª99 average reduction in real prices all customers (including wholesale) 31% 36% residential customers 21% 30% industrial/commercial customers 32% 36% share (%) of utilities with greater than 20% decrease in real prices all customers 87% 93% residential customers 64% 84% industrial/commercial customers 92% 94% $ / kwh all customers class (including wholesale): graph of year-by-year real prices 1980- 1985- utility 1999 1999 1 alabama power company 42% 40% 2 allegheny power system 21% 13% 3 arizona public service company 41% 50% 4 arkansas power & light 34% 34% 5 baltimore gas & electric 28% 29% 6 carolina power & light 21% 37% 7 central illinois light company (cilco) 45% 46% 8 central louisiana electric company (cleco) 36% 41% 9 central power & light 37% 30% 10 commonwealth edison 40 % 46% 11 consolidated edison 43% 43% 12 dayton power & light 32% 37% 13 delmarva power & light 42% 37% 14 detroit edison 27% 34% 15 duke power 11% 27% 16 duquesne light 22% 35% 17 el paso electric company 40% 44% 18 empire district electric company 22% 15% 19 georgia power company 29% 28% 20 gulf power company 48% 43% 21 gulf states utilities 24% 49% 22 idaho power 20% 26% 23 ies utilities 46% 51% 24 illinois power 23% 25% 25 indianapolis power & light 28% 26% 26 jersey central power 30% 40% 27 kansas gas & electric 19% 28% 28 louisiana power & light 18% 25% 29 louisville gas & electric 45% 54% 30 metropolitan edison 53% 57% 31 mississippi power & light 31% 38% 32 mississippi power company 43% 39% 33 monongahela power 22% 21% 34 montana dakota utilities 20% 34% 35 nevada power company 27% 28% 36 new orleans public service 33% 29% 37 niagara mohawk power 5% 11% 38 northeast utilities 42% 50% 39 oklahoma gas & electric 22% 38% 40 pacific gas & electric 16% 31% 41 potomac edison 24% 21% 42 potomac electric power 32% 31% 43 psi 35% 43% 44 public service company of oklahoma 30% 46% 45 puget sound energy 4% 32% 46 reliant energy inc. 23% 39% 47 rochester gas & electric 3% 17% 48 san diego gas & electric 48% 56% 49 savannah electric power 40% 41% 50 sierra pacific power 47% 46% 51 south carolina electric & gas 30% 40% 52 southwestern electric power 31% 45% 53 texas-new mexico power 29% 39% 54 tucson electric power company 39% 34% 55 txu electric company 41% 51% 56 utilicorp united 48% 51% 57 west penn 35% 28% 58 west texas utilities 19% 37% 59 wisconsin electric power 37% 39% 60 wisconsin power & light 40 % 37% average 31% 36% percent reduction in real rates for all customers (including wholesale customers) "

(in the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network password.) there are still some bugs that will be worked out by tuesday, but i thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed. if you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-4382. thanks, gavin "

 as you know, enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron. we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. even though enron has entered into this agreement, u.s. and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. in particular, to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. in addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller, lance schuler, robert eickenroht, mark haedicke, rob walls or greg whalley of enron. it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. if you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact lance schuler (713/853-5419), robert eickenroht (713/853-3155), mark haedicke (713/853-6544) or rob walls (713/646-6017). thank you for your help in this matter.

 mark dan reck is hoping to enter into discussions with canadian national, who are insisting upon the inclusion of a non-raid provision in the confidentiality agreement, the offending clause is attached. in speaking with dan, his view is that it is more likely that canadian national would want to employ some of our people than us wanting to employ any but their most senior people. the period proposed is for one year after the date we have terminated our discussions. i have asked that canadian national consider a 6 month period and they have not yet responded. in looking at the legal policy on this, i see that the head business person and you, as the general counsel, will need to be comfortable with this provision. once you have had the chance to review it i would be grateful if you could advise as to what we are able to accept and who you believe is the head business person who will also need to sign off on this. many thanks. marcus " 
r. crane, bob dimitry, dirk hernandez, morela juvane, danilo rickard, craig robinson, richard t. stapley, cecil subject: sub-cost production to rescue european pulp market x-sdoc: 807920 x-zlid: zl-edrm-enron-v2-causholli-m-235.eml brussels, aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - the pressure of producing market pulp below cost is likely to provide its own outlet, according to a number of sources. suppliers from north america's west coast have been producing in the red for some time now and severe downtime will be forced upon them, providing the sharp slimming of inventories which is required for recovery. one supplier predicted, it won't be long before we get better prices and conditions. suppliers in the southern states of the us and eucalyptus producers are suffering similarly unprofitable business. southern pine is a rarity now in europe, as the home market proves more attractive. and some south american eucalyptus producers have turned the supply tap off in italy. but italian activity has proved a reliable barometer for market direction in the past and it is the italian buyers who are seeking fixed contracts for two to three months in advance now. this is reported to be spreading north. there are rumblings in south america about a correction to the eucalyptus price. the weakened dollar means that latin american eucalyptus priced in dollars is cheap compared with european volumes priced in euros. while producers are likely to wait at least until october for the market to see some post-vacation period momentum in the paper market, the intention is clear. major producers of northern bleached softwood kraft have indicated they intend to go no lower than $450/tonne, yet the possibility of $440/tonne in september was not dismissed by buyers or sellers. the foex benchmark is still slipping, albeit slowly, and there may be another $10/tonne to go before the absolute bottom is reached. this would drive out the spot market almost completely, in particular as prices in asia are now at very similar levels to those in europe. pulp buying in asia is said to have picked up thanks to the low prices. one supplier said, the spot market in europe seems more or less to have disappeared. the effect of such low prices combined with any pick-up in woodfree paper sales could provide sufficient impetus for pulp prices to creep up again in the fourth quarter, according to one source. but he warned that if higher cost producers were encouraged by this to enter the fray at 100% production, it could pave the way for a rocky 12 months bumping along the bottom. norscan inventories are predicted to end august much as they did in july, which would be contrary to the trend for the month and set the scene for falling stocks in the fourth quarter, if demand picks up to anything like normal levels.

 from: shelley corman i have enjoyed getting to know the market services team over the last month. i appreciate your candor and patience as you re-introduce me to the day-to-day issues facing nng, tw and fgt. over the last month, i have also had the opportunity to listen to the ets commercial group and customers talk about their expectations for our group; review customer feedback contained in the mastio survey, and understand market services staff concerns voice in the pulse survey. let me start by saying that there is one piece of feedback that is unanimous: the market service team reliably manages both the physical and scheduling aspects of day-to-day gas transportation. this is certainly the foundation for our team‰Ûªs continued success. the feedback also identifies opportunities for further enhancements: improving our accounting and contract systems through automation; developing better tools and reports for making commercial decisions; addressing customer concerns about the accuracy of metering systems; and providing ongoing customer training opportunities. the attached slides summarize this feedback and propose a list of actions that we can take to respond to the feedback. for example, the creation of a customer call center and the nng measurement desk are specific responses to customer feedback. we are also making several organizational changes to enable our team to better support the ets commercial group and the ets customers. see attached chart i am pleased to announce that brad holmes will be joining our group on may 29 as the director of commercial support systems (formerly called electronic business development). brad has over a decade of experience in the areas of customer service, business planning and e-business strategy with both the williams company and with a business consulting firm. he has a b.a. from the university of pittsburgh and an mba from rice university. brad will be responsible for developing business requirements for new systems, maintaining and enhancing customer websites, customer training and process improvements. brad will also lead the new customer call center and standards development/gisb. theresa hess will join brad‰Ûªs team. steve january, sr. director gas control, and lynn blair, director, customer service teams, will continue to provide strong leadership, focusing on the daily capacity management activities and outage implementation on nng and tw. steve also continues to have responsibility for eott pipeline control. mike bryant and sheila nacey will lead fgt capacity management. as manager, gas control and optimization, mike will be responsible for gas control, pipeline capacity modeling and outage coordination. sheila, director, fgt customer service team, will be responsible for scheduling and invoicing. sheila will be working with lynn blair to identify rotational opportunities across ets‰Ûª customer teams. rick dietz will continue in his role as the director, commercial support (formerly contract administration) where he is responsible for the contract administration and accounting control functions. in addition, rick will lead the measurement desk as we expand this concept from fgt to nng. donna scott, director, transportation analysis, will continue to be responsible for budgeting, employee training, leadership development, data request coordination, and new business opportunities. finally, we are renaming our group gas logistics to reinforce the message that we are a service organization, focused on meeting the transportation needs of our customers each day. i am excited about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

 two answers: 1. just yourselves. sandra has laid in an excessive quantity of vittles and libations. 2. good idea. tryiing to launch an effort like that now would be a nightmare, but after conoco, we'll have a lot of organizational work anyway. thanks. df kathy ringblom 06/12/2000 08:54 am to: drew cc: subject: two subjects 1 - is there anything we can bring saturday night? 2 - regarding the record retention problem, i was thinking that when this conoco case is over, that might be a good time to go through all of the boxes we have pulled (probably close to 150) and weed out all of the stuff we don't need anymore - which in the case of many of the boxes, may be the entire contents - instead of sending them all back to storage. maybe we could distribute copies of each department's record retention policy, figure out a way for the owner of the boxes' contents to come into the box room, review them and make a decision at that time.

special provisions to contract for short-term sale and purchase of natural gas dated july 1, 2001 by and between bp energy company (‰ÛÏbpec‰Ûù) and ________________________ 1. the following provision shall be inserted at the end of section 1.2 oral transaction procedure: the parties hereby consent to the electronic recording of their oral agreements and related telephone discussions. failure by the confirming party to send, or the other party to return, an executed transaction confirmation shall not invalidate any gas purchase and sale transaction (each a ‰ÛÏtransaction‰Ûù and collectively ‰ÛÏtransactions‰Ûù) agreed to by the parties in an edi transmission or telephone conversation. the parties agree not to contest or assert any defense to the validity or enforceability of telephonic transactions entered into pursuant to the contract under laws relating to whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the party to be thereby bound, or the authority of any employee of the party to enter into a transaction. in the absence of a written transaction confirmation, recorded telephone conversations shall be considered a ‰ÛÏwriting‰Ûù and may be used as evidence of the transaction. if a written transaction confirmation exists, in the event of conflict between the terms and provisions of the written transaction confirmation and a recorded telephone conversation, the terms and provisions of the written transaction confirmation shall control to the extent of any such conflict. 2. the following provisions shall be added as section 3.3: 3.3. (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this contract (including, without limitation, anything in section 11 of this contract), in the event (a) seller is unable to sell and deliver the contract quantity as a result of an event of force majeure, and (b) the contract price is a fixed price, seller shall pay buyer for each mmbtu of gas not delivered as provided in section 3.2 above. (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this contract (including, without limitation, anything in section 11 of this contract), in the event (a) buyer is unable to purchase and receive the contract quantity as a result of an event of force majeure, and (b) the contract price is a fixed price, buyer shall pay seller for each mmbtu of gas not purchased and received as provided in section 3.2 above. 3. in the first sentence of section 7.2, delete ‰ÛÏthe later of the payment date or‰Ûù. 4. the following text shall be added as section 7.5: 7.5 in the event that buyer and seller are each required to pay an amount in the same month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each party may be aggregated and the parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed. 5. section 10.1 should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following text: 10.1 when reasonable grounds for insecurity of payment or title to the gas arise, either party (the ‰ÛÏrequesting party‰Ûù) may demand adequate assurance of performance from the other party (the ‰ÛÏaffected party‰Ûù). adequate assurance shall mean sufficient security in the form and for the term reasonably specified by requesting party, including, but not limited to, a standby irrevocable letter of credit (in form and substance and from a commercial u.s. bank acceptable to requesting party in its sole discretion), a prepayment, a security interest in an asset acceptable to requesting party, a performance bond or a guarantee by an entity that is acceptable to requesting party in its sole discretion. in the event either party shall (i) make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (ii) fail to make any payment on the date due; (iii) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize, or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors or have such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it; (iv) otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced); (v) be unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (vi) fail to provide requesting party with adequate assurance in accordance with this section 10 in an amount and form acceptable to requesting party in its sole discretion within seventy-two (72) hours of a demand therefor; then requesting party shall have the right to either withhold and/or suspend deliveries of gas or payment upon no less than one (1) business day of written notice, and/or establish a date on which this contract shall terminate if such default is not cured (‰ÛÏearly termination date‰Ûù) upon giving two (2) business days of written notice to affected party; provided that upon the occurrence of a default listed in items (iii) and (iv) of section 10.1 hereof, as it may apply to any party, this contract shall automatically terminate, without notice, as if an early termination date has been immediately declared (in which case, the day of such automatic termination shall be the early termination date). seller may immediately suspend deliveries to buyer hereunder in the event buyer has not paid any amount due seller hereunder on or before the second business day following the date such payment is due. the non-defaulting party‰Ûªs rights under this section 10 are in addition to any and all other remedies available hereunder. the parties specifically agree that this contract and all transactions pursuant hereto are ‰ÛÏforward contracts‰Ûù as such term is defined in the united states bankruptcy code, 11 u.s.c. section 101(25). 6. the following provisions shall be added as section 10.3: 10.3 if an early termination date has been declared or deemed to have been declared, as the case may be, requesting party shall have the right to liquidate any or all transactions, including any portion of a transaction not yet fully delivered, then outstanding by: (a) closing out each transaction being liquidated at its market value so that each such transaction is canceled and a settlement payment in an amount equal to the difference between such market value and the contract value, as defined below, of such transaction shall be due to the buyer under the transaction if such market value exceeds the contract value and to the seller if the opposite is the case; and (b) discounting each amount then due under clause 10.3(a) above to present value in a commercially reasonable manner as at the time of liquidation (to take account of the period between the date of liquidation and the date on which such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to the relevant transaction); and (c) setting off or aggregating, as appropriate, all such settlement payments (discounted as appropriate) and (at the election of the non-defaulting party) any or all other amounts owing between the parties under this contract so that all such amounts are aggregated and/or netted to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other. such net amount due shall be paid by the close of business on the business day following the early termination date. for purposes of this section 10, ‰ÛÏcontract value‰Ûù means the quantity of gas or other product remaining to be delivered under a transaction multiplied by the contract price per mmbtu. ‰ÛÏmarket value‰Ûù means the quantity of gas or other product remaining to be delivered under a transaction multiplied by the market price per mmbtu determined by the non-defaulting party in a commercially reasonable manner. the rate of interest used in calculating net present value shall be determined by the non-defaulting party in a commercially reasonable manner. 7. the following section shall be added as section 13.9: 13.9 the parties agree that they will maintain this contract and all parts and contents hereof, or any information exchanged under this contract, in strict confidence, and that it will not cause or permit disclosure of the contents hereof, or any information exchanged hereby, to any nonaffiliated third party without the prior written consent of the other party hereto; provided, however, that disclosure by either party is permitted (a) to such party‰Ûªs legal and financial consultants; (b) in the event and to the extent it is required by a court or agency exercising jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof; (c) to such party‰Ûªs permitted successor or assign hereunder; and (d) to the extent necessary to obtain transportation of the gas purchased and sold hereunder.

observations growth in the gas-fired electric generation market will be the major factor in determining the size and timing of new gas system infrastructure new backbone capacity and supply may well be needed within the next five years, or so lead time for adding new capacity is significant, probably 3 to 5 years, at a minimum requires coordination with upstream capacity additions will need to consider how new backbone capacity additions will be addressed in gas accord ii option: build backbone capacity additions into settlement agree on amount of slack capacity and added backbone capital costs which are reflected in the rates considerations: considerable uncertainty in growth of eg gas demand level of slack capacity needed promotes gas-on-gas competition moderates gas and electric commodity prices improves supply reliability to meet uncertain future demands new capacity will need matching upstream capacity cost impact of new capacity may still need a mechanism to address further capacity needs option: let market decide include mechanism to address backbone transmission capacity additions and rate increases considerations: market tends to wait until constraints occur, which: decreases reliability increases commodity costs reduces gas-on-gas competition what is pg&e‰Ûªs obligation? allows for uncertainty in need and timing of projects new capacity will need matching

 we have traditionally have had currency issues in canada regarding p&l preservation versus cashflow preservation. we have been valued in p&l under the us$ but due to revenue canada reasons our functional currency has been c$ (i.e. the preponderence of cashflows were in c$ from the legacy gas deals, petrocanada, suncour, etc, and the ppa position). since trader evaluation at year end has been in us$, traders would hedge c$ positions immediately as the trade occured. the hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book. from a p&l systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's p&l in us$. however, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades. there was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from sap and settlement dates of the respective trade type. it is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems. to a certain extent, i am indifferent if it is us$ or c$. the timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the sap system. they are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by jan 29. this is the date that they have been told to meet by houston. as a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by mon jan 28.

come down david lazarus, chronicle staff writer thursday, may 31, 2001 ,2001 san francisco chronicle url: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/31/mn154796.dtl sacramento -- gov. gray davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by california's municipal utility districts, which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators. davis said in an interview with the chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies. the governor's tough talk came as california suffered through a stage 2 power alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices. so far this year, the state has paid more than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities. in a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state generators if they continue gouging california ratepayers, the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices. he said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance. we're going to get that power one way or another, davis said. municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. in northern california, there are municipal utilities in alameda, palo alto, redding, sacramento and santa clara. los angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state. 30 days till contract details for the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts california is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities. he said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full details to be made available within 30 days. although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents, insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations. the chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent. rude awakening while going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing davis needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate the texas big boys and dig deep into california's pockets. yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which davis insisted they are required to do by law. he met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as california faces a summer of potential blackouts. the governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed to make most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market. apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration. davis told the chronicle last night that he is still trying very hard to promote this notion that we're all in this together. while unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged, davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800 megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways. eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes. representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment, nor could a spokesperson for the california municipal utilities association in sacramento. i told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or involuntarily, the governor said. uncertain future it remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play ball. to date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way. in march, lodi's municipal utility district and a northern california municipal utility cooperative that includes palo alto, santa clara and alameda told pacific gas and electric co. that they will not participate in rolling blackouts during power shortages. i won't

notes from meeting with perfect.com. (cameron sellers - vp, bizdev and mike davenport, dir prod mktg.) perfect.com views themselves as an infrastructure player looking to add value in three market segments for the b2b industry: netmarketmakers, inudstrysponsoredexchanges, trading/commerce platform providers. perfect feels there are already too many nmms. feels a shakeout / consolidation will come soon. perfect's focus in the short term (6 month timeframe): they are talking to market makers/verticals in the chemicals, plastics industry, etc. want to find nmms that will sustain a year from now. wants to go after providers like ariba, commerce one. long term focus (12-18 months): more revenue from consulting, hand-holding customers through service. envisions a set of wizards that will walk customers through the process of setting up rfqs with dedicated support form the consulting team. perfect wants to be best of breed in sourcing (85% of sourcing is not based purely on price). current solutions will fall short since most focus purely on price which serves the need of only 15% of the exchange transactions. perfect thinks that content and sourcing will remain the most important part of any nmm. rest - fulfillment etc. is not as critical a component. perfect would love to get into cmrc/arba partnership. its strategy to do this is to form a partnership with a vertical/nmm that uses arba/cmrc. this will give perfect a chance to work with cmrc/arba, and demonstrate the goodness of their solution. this way they will be taken more seriously. currently asp model with transaction fees. nmm takes 5-10% of value of transaction. perfect wants some of that (maybe 5% of that 5-10%). also open to a subscription based model. as far as competition, perfect considers casbah and idapta to be competition. casbah has had a lot of talent leave. also, vcs saying stop funding for a while - wait and see approach. consider idapta (previously intelligent/digital) to be secondary competition. perfect thinks lots of people saying / touting rfq capability. but, under the hood, basic rfq template that's basically blank. current customers : 6 in all. transportation logistics, seafood exchange, agriculture, it services. employees: currently 45. ramping to 100 by end of year. as an example, mike set up the transportation customer with what would have been a total of 16 billable hours. perfect does not want to partner with a company that will not show off perfect's technology. most rfqs in existence today are of the post & reply format. companies are sending perfect their rfq examples for attributes to add to their software. problem with post & reply is the firehose issue - buyers get bombarded with 100s of possible suppliers and they want to avoid dealing with that. want a list of top prospects filtered/sorted by the buyer's criteria. not going for pure price driven markets. a nmm can work with perfect to pre-calibrate the knob settings for rfqs. this will serve up customers a best-known sourcing value model for their particular industry which they will then be free to tweak. perfect will have a professional services organization that will a business technologist team much like a big5 consulting firm that will advise and set up default button settings for clients to help them configure their rfqs. perfect's biggest barrier to entry is that they have a 4-5 month lead on their competitors on the multi-dimensional rfq technology. also their technology for their algorithm is patent pending and is their golden egg. this was developed after much in-depth research performed by paul milgrom (sp?) of stanford, and his phd students. they think this lead is significant enough to allow them to win with nmms, ises. they are focussing marketing efforts with the nmms and ises on proving defenitive value add/roi by showing the use of their technology against the old post and reply roi. not stressing just quantitive roi, but qualititative roi as well i.e. efficiency of perfect engine as the best economical. perfect would like us to bring perspective - services v/s software revenue - different valuations put on these revenue models by wall street. their old revenue model was 90/10 transactions/services. their transactions based rev model will be tiered. i.e. percentage will be lower the larger the transaction amount, etc. they estimate that within 12-18 months, the transaction based revenue model will cease to exist in the industry (contradiction?). their backup is to have 1) consulting service revenue 2) market intelligence service revenue now looking more at larger revenue quicker => professional services will help here they think. (what do we think?) market intelligence may be biggest revenue maker. their phd eceonomists can do trend anlaysis and sell the results to nmms who will sell to suppliers at the nmms to be better able to serve their customers. they can also use the results to better set their default knob settings/profiles. systems integrators (sis) that can help integrate perfect technology with different systems/solutions out there - include neon, ondisplay, tibco, webmethods. perfect would love to partner with plasticsnet, materialsnet, esteele - the big boys. as far as partners, calico seems eager to partner with perfect. wants to develop a solution together and beta test it with a couple of calico's customers. will thus guinea pig with some nmms so as to be seamless with the rest of the nmms. capstan does logistics - works w/ webmethods and itwo. will use capstan as gateway to nmms, and ises. software offers several levels of service. basic level is just a match on product need. next level would be inventory watch/management, lastly erp integration. as far as partnerships, perfect wants to learn by doing. if while working with partners, they find a problem too complex, and need to get a 3rd party involved, they will pull them in as well. they feel this kind of networking is doable since there's a small community of b2b component providers. wants to be integratable plug and play to whoever becomes king of end to end. asp model - concerned about how to connect with server based software. wants recommendation if possible as part of the report. one big issue is that customers care about reliability and are hesitant to change from existing process. specially with hosting and asp. also, they are not comfortable giving out their sourcing data and may view it as competitive advantage... cameron would like us to give a recommendation in the report on revenue models. pay per use (fixed v/s percentage), monthly subscriptions, annual license, etc. "

 i received a call from jill zively about our supply at mtr 5999. late friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into midcon instead of hpl. the nomination into hpl for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d. jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at gas daily. i changed deal 278748 to reflect this change for saturday forward. since this is priced at gas daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact. we need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary. d "

 this gives a little flavor of how we factor into the backbone capacity market. category: backbone, dwdm, enron communications description building a better backbone - and business plan : detail: by carol wilson, week september 6, 1999 6:23 am pt the numbers are staggering: six major new national fiber-optic networks will come on line during the next two years at a cost of $18 billion. those new networks are in addition to those already built and operated by the big three of long-distance: at&t, mci worldcom and sprint. thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable are being installed in ducts to which new fiber can be easily added by companies such as enron communications, frontier communications, ixc communications, level 3 communications, qwest communications international and williams communications. and that's just a piece of the story. while competition in the backbone network business is booming, new technologies coming into the market will make it much easier to increase bandwidth available on any fiber-optic network tenfold or more. dense wavelength division multiplexing (dwdm) systems now exist to put data traffic onto 160 different wavelengths on a single fiber-optic cable. technology exists today to enable each of those wavelengths to transport 10 gigabits per second of data. within two years, that will reach 40 gigabits per wavelength per second. in effect, the backbone of the internet is being rebuilt. the next step: recover all those costs of construction,'' says analyst peter bernstein at infonautics consulting. and that step may be more difficult than building the networks themselves.'' the combination of major new network construction and new technology for adding network capacity has led industry analysts and executives to predict a bandwidth glut that is likely to drive down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long-distance telephony has plummeted in the past few years. frontier communications admitted as much earlier this year when its second-quarter earnings weren't up to expectations. rather than a free fall in prices, however, expect the market to quickly find new ways to use bandwidth, both in terms of network-based applications and bigger backbone networks to support the rapidly growing field of faster access via digital subscriber line (dsl) and cable modems. the challenge for network operators is to create new business models that capitalize on something other than cheaper bandwidth. i think the danger isn't so much of a glut as a lack of planning for the backbone network that could cause some major problems, says claudia bacco, an analyst at telechoice who studies the development of dsl. once dsl starts selling as a volume service, it will very quickly increase the demand for bandwidth in the backbone. service providers need to have planned ahead. it's not surprising, then, to see a growing number of alliances between the new backbone builders and the competitive local exchange carriers (clecs) that have been building dsl networks in major markets across the u.s. qwest invested in both covad communications and rhythms netconnect-ions, for instance, and a third data clec, northpoint communications, includes enron, frontier and level 3 among its strategic partners. that doesn't mean, however, that all of the companies investing billions in burying fiber-optic cable stand to reap rich rewards, cautions bernstein at infonautics. the problem isn't a glut of bandwidth, but a glut of service providers, he says. if everyone has the same business model and is going after the same customers, that's a problem. in addition, there are timing issues . . . if you build it, they will come - but not necessarily when you need them to. at least nine players have built or are building national fiber-optic backbone networks. these look very similar, says fred harris, director of network planning and design at sprint. there are generally three east-west routes and three or four north-south routes that everyone builds, he says. new york to san francisco, atlanta to los angeles, seattle to boston - everybody has fiber either in or near those corridors. in earlier network deployments, the fiber was buried, never to be exhumed. but today's fiber cables go into ducts, allowing fibers to be pulled out or slid in later. capacity can be added without any backhoes. today's newer fiber-optic cable, from companies such as corning and lucent technologies, is designed to support higher transmission speeds without the light dispersion problems that limited speeds or distances on other fiber-optic cables. dwdm technology and optical amplifiers, which boost the power of a laser's signal over a given wavelength, enable bandwidth to be added and allow signals to travel farther without the need for as many repeaters to boost signals along the way. eliminating repeaters in a long-distance network wrings out installation, maintenance and power costs. as harris points out, if every company building a national backbone has 30 fibers along each major route, and each fiber can carry 80 different wavelengths of light, that's more than 20,000 different signals. today, most of those signals would be powered by synchronous optical network (sonet) gear, which operates at 2.5 gigabits per second, but a growing number have moved up to gear that operates at 10 gbps. both lucent and nortel networks have announced equipment that supports 160 wavelengths on a single cable, and other vendors will have similar equipment within the next two years. also coming into the market by 2002 will be new sonet gear that quadruples the current transmission rates from 10 gbps to 40 gbps. mci worldcom is testing these systems, known as oc-768 transmission systems, and expects to have one commercially available by early 2001, says rama nune, senior manager of optical and data network technology development. nune stresses, however, that what's more important than having all the bandwidth is knowing how to intelligently provision services over it and manage it. new models not surprisingly, most of the newer network operators have quickly moved to talking about services, not bandwidth. there are exceptions to this: enron is building a network that transmits internet protocol (ip)-based traffic directly over a fiber-optic network, with no intervening transport systems or protocols. but its network is built to provide backbone bandwidth for internet service providers and content providers, says stan hanks, vice president of research and technology at the company. at level 3, falling backbone service prices would be good news, says spokesman david powers. we want to drive prices down by reducing the underlying cost of the network, he says. we think we can do it because we are building a green-field network that doesn't have the cost of legacy technology like circuit switches. most other network operators are looking to add services to their mix, including web hosting, to create a differentiated service. mci worldcom through its uunet subsidiary, frontier, qwest and others have announced web hosting services. greater bandwidth and lower prices also will enable new video services to be delivered over the internet, says vab goel, vice president of ip engineering and technology at qwest. one of the things qwest is doing is building its own access rings in 25 major markets, goel says. we think this network will drive cost down and increase performance for value-added applications which can be delivered over an ip network. today, most video is compressed. with faster access speeds, you can watch tv shows over the internet. this becomes interesting when you talk about having access to any tv show broadcast anywhere around the globe. in addition to enabling new services, however, the sudden availability of bandwidth will dramatically change the way services are priced and sold. it's the next great challenge of the internet - deciding how you are going to bill customers and what they will be willing to pay for, analyst bernstein says. i'm not sure anyone knows yet. part of that challenge is matching a service that customers value with the need to recover the high costs of expanding a network. george gilder likes to say that bandwidth will be free - well, putting in 20,000 channels of oc-48 [2.5-gbps transmision] isn't free; it costs billions, sprint's harris says. and the same thing goes when you build up the local copper network to do dsl or cable modems. already, however, dsl prices are dropping to $30 to $40 per month for a consumer service that offers up to 1.5 megabits per second. businesses still typically pay $125 to $400 per month for higher-speed services that offer the same bandwidth in both upload and download modes. that compares very favorably to the $2,000 per month most companies paid for a t1 line until the past two years. but with customers assuming bandwidth will be cheap, how will nine backbone network providers recover their billions in investment? i don't have a crystal ball, says nune at mci. with the access speeds going up - whether it be adsl [asymmetric dsl] or gigabit ethernet - we anticipate many rich applications to drive the bandwidth of our customers. providing those applications - or at least building into the network the right hooks for new services - is the best hope for building a new revenue base, harris agrees. there will still be room for charging higher rates as well for levels of reliability and transmission speeds, says qwest's goel, but those charges will likely be packaged as part of the application cost. in a world where everyone has access to the same technology, it will be the business issues that ultimately decide who succeeds at building - and sustaining - the backbone of the next internet.

 glen, your alive..!!!!!!!!!! glad to see you are still around. what's with the new job? for me the new job is obvious. we started playing a drinking game where every time the name enron was mentioned you had to do a shot. minutes later i was fired for drunken insubordination. sometime in the next 3-4 weeks i'll start working for ubs warburg (union bank of switzerland). i'm hoping working for a swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (terrorism, enron, anthrax). no one should want to harm the canadian working for the swiss company. actually, my division was sold to ubs so the transition should not be that hard. mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale. if i could make the same amount of money for ubs i did for enron last year, i'd finally get the bonus i've always been looking for. anyways, i'll keep you posted. my email hasn't changed yet, but i'm sure it will. if you need to get in contact with me try, how's the personal life going? i hope all is well. jon "

 flood warning for kenai river national weather service anchorage ak 330 pm wed august 29 2001 the national weather service has issued a flood warning for the kenai river, including the areas of kenai lake, cooper landing, and kenai keys. heavy rain over the upper portion of the kenai basin on monday night through tuesday evening has caused a major rise in water levels on the kenai river and its tributaries. the gage on the trail river at lawing has risen 3.4 ft in the past 30 hours and the snow river rose 4.0 feet before cresting tuesday afternoon. additional precipitation of up to 1.5 inches is expected and will prolong the crest. water levels at cooper landing will probably crest sometime late friday afternoon, with a stage slightly below 14 ft. primrose campground is the main area affected by stages below 14 ft. the snow glacier lake has not released at this time. minor flooding is also possible at kenai keys. stages are expected to crest late friday downstream of kenai keys at about 13 feet on the usgs gage and at about 12 feet at kenai keys. the heaviest rains over the kenai peninsula have ended, with lighter amounts of rain forecast for thursday and friday. smaller streams should begin falling today, with the kenai river falling over the weekend. a flood warning means that flooding is imminent or occurring. this statement will be updated at 10 am august 30 or earlier if conditions warrant. sdl $$ nnnn [ancflwanc/999127820] edis-08-29-01 1630 pdt --------------------------------------------------------- to update or terminate your subscription to this email service visit our webpage at http://www.incident.com/edismail.html. please do not reply to this message: replies may be treated as errors and result in your subscription being deleted. for non-subscription queries, email we cannot process subscription, unsubscribe or selection-change requests via email: please use the webpage for those requests. edis is operated by the governor's office of emergency services, state of california. this email relay is offered by incident.com as a public service. because of the complexity of this system and its dependence on other systems, we cannot be responsible for delays or failures in transmission. --------------------------------------------------------- "

october 16, 2001 outline of cpuc concerns regarding transwestern‰Ûªs initial settlement offer: tariff provisions regarding operational capacity: does not contain sufficiently detailed description of ‰ÛÏoperational capacity.‰Ûù should be distinguished from other types of capacity, including unsubscribed capacity. specific sources of ‰ÛÏoperational capacity‰Ûù should be explicitly stated. with respect to the proposed definition of operational capacity at the bottom of page 2 of your october 12, 2001 letter, the use of the phrase ‰ÛÏsuch as‰Ûù removes any limiting feature that would define and distinguish operational capacity from any other type of capacity. because use of ‰ÛÏsuch as‰Ûù indicates transwestern‰Ûªs operational capacity is derived from sources other than lower winter ambient temperatures and related compressor efficiencies, we would suggest a more specific definition, naming all the sources of capacity transwestern uses for ‰ÛÏoperational capacity.‰Ûù if transwestern uses unscheduled firm capacity of other subscribers, or capacity held for firm service reliability (with the amount of such firm service reliability held specifically identified in related tariff sheets), those sources should be identified. does not contain sufficiently detailed description of the kind of service available for ‰ÛÏoperational capacity.‰Ûù are all services available? which services are not available? how can capacity available only when ambient temperatures reach a certain point be guaranteed for firm service? how can transwestern guarantee firm service for capacity that exceeds its design capabilities, including receipt and delivery points design capabilities? what kind of capacity is sold as interruptible service? does not contain sufficiently detailed description of the kind of rates that transwestern will consider for ‰ÛÏoperational capacity‰Ûù given the nature of the sources of the capacity? for example, will operational capacity always be sold at a one-part rate? without a reservation charge? with only a usage charge? with roll-over rights? does not indicate specifically how transwestern will assure that its recourse rate is always available for all services and for all capacity, including operational capacity, how and when the shipper is notified of the availability of the capacity requested at the recourse rate. does not clearly explain how competing bids are evaluated when recourse rates and negotiated rates are bid for the same capacity. ferc‰Ûªs adamant requirement that the recourse rate be actually available as a real, viable alternative to shippers would require that available capacity, including operational capacity, be prorated first to meet the requests of shippers who opt for the recourse rate. any remaining available capacity could then be allocated among the shippers bidding negotiated rates (assuming they are other than a fixed rate below the recourse rate). unless shippers who bid the recourse rate can obtain the capacity they want without having to also bid a negotiated rate, the ferc‰Ûªs justification and rationale for permitting negotiated rates is eviscerated. it is also not clear that ferc policy would permit the npv of a negotiated rate that is based on future price factors to be evaluated according to factors available at the time of evaluating bids. does not indicate the kind of service and rates to which roll-over rights will be available or will not be available. b. tariff provisions for negotiated rates the definition of the term ‰ÛÏnegotiated rate‰Ûù as proposed on page 2 of your october 12, 2001 letter does not distinguish it from a market rate or from a market-based rate. because transwestern is not authorized to use market rates or market-based rates for transportation rates, the distinction should be specifically explained and perhaps illustrated in the tariff so that shippers understand the available bid alternatives. also, after reviewing the references offered in support of tw‰Ûªs claim that the ferc has established precedent for allowing natural gas market indices differentials to be used in negotiated transportation rates, we do not believe that precedent is in fact established or legally binding.

(‰ÛÏcaledonia‰Ûù) dated as of march 15, 1999 (‰ÛÏagreement‰Ûù) re: notice of proposed modifications to caledonia interconnection facilities ladies and gentlemen: this letter serves as notice to tva, pursuant to sections 3.3(c) and 14.1 of the agreement, that caledonia or an affiliate thereof (collectively, ‰ÛÏcaledonia‰Ûù) proposes to construct or cause to be constructed certain proposed modifications to the existing interconnection facilities of the caledonia generating facility (the ‰ÛÏfacility‰Ûù). such modifications, which are further described below, will be located at the site and will be used in connection with the operation of the facility and the transmission of power therefrom. caledonia also is contemplating the construction of an approximately 3.2 mile long 500 kv transmission line segment and an associated substation that would enable the facility to be interconnected with the transmission system of alabama power, a southern company utility affiliate (‰ÛÏsouthern‰Ûù), at __________ (collectively, the ‰ÛÏsouthern interconnect‰Ûù), resulting in the facility being interconnected to both the tva and southern transmission systems. caledonia presently is engaged in discussions with southern about the nature and terms of the southern interconnect. while certain details still may be subject to minor variations, the present plan is that upon completion southern would own the newly constructed substation and caledonia would own the interconnecting transmission level line running from the facility‰Ûªs switchyard to the substation. caledonia wishes to commence the installation of the southern interconnect as soon as possible, but in any event not later than [_____, 2000]. the installation of the southern interconnect will necessitate the installation of certain breakers and associated equipment [more detail] at the facility that will interface with and affect the coordination and operation of the caledonia interconnection facilities in conjunction with the southern interconnect. attached to this notice are the proposed diagrams and specifications for the modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities, which diagrams and specifications are hereby submitted for tva‰Ûªs review and approval pursuant to section 3.3(c) of the agreement. [as required by the agreement, the diagrams and specifications were prepared consistent with good engineering practice and specify the equipment to be used as to manufacturer, model, type, technical specifications and other pertinent information, as required by the agreement. caledonia will reimburse tva for the actual costs of any work performed in connection with its review of the diagrams and specifications as provided in section 3.2(c) of the agreement.] caledonia does not believe that, consistent with good utility practice, any modifications to the tva interconnection facilities, or a new system impact study, would or should be necessary or appropriate as a result of these modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities (or the installation of the southern interconnect). the engineering firm assisting caledonia on these projects has certified to caledonia that both the installation of the breakers and associated equipment and the southern interconnect will not adversely affect the reliability, safety or operation of the tva system as compared to the current configurement of the facility and its interconnection facilities. [perhaps include a more specific engineering supported reason.] because time is of the essence for caledonia in connection with the commencement of these projects, caledonia requests that, as provided in section 3.3(c) of the agreement, tva provide notice of acceptance or disapproval of the diagrams and specifications within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt by tva of this notice, together with, if the modifications are not approved for some reason, an explanation of the reasons therefor and a description of the specific changes that would render the diagrams and specifications acceptable, pursuant to the standard of review therefor as provided in section 3.3(b) and with respect to the safety and efficiency of tva‰Ûªs system and employees as provided in section 3.3(c). [caledonia does not anticipate that any of the work to be performed in connection with the installation of the southern interconnect would directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on the tva control area or other electric systems but should caledonia determine that such [might possibly] be the case it will provide the notice thereof to tva‰Ûªs transmission security and services personnel as contemplated by section 7.1 of the agreement.] caledonia does not believe that any amendment to the agreement is required to make the modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities or to install the southern interconnect. rather, caledonia would propose to supplement, pursuant to section 6.4 of the agreement, the operating procedures for the facility. oversight of the types of operational changes that arise on account of the southern interconnect are expressly delegated to the operating committee (see, e.g., sections 6.4(b)(iv) (matters pertaining to changes or additions to the interconnection facilities) and (d) (clearances and switching practices, daily estimates of capacity and energy, etc.)). once you have had an opportunity to review the diagrams and specifications for the proposed modifications, we would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to determine what operating policies tva may reasonably require with respect to the operation of the facility, taking into account the dual interconnect. by way of illustration, caledonia would propose to put in place procedures that would permit switching between the southern and tva interconnects only during off peak hours [and would be willing to discuss with tva providing tva with the responsibility for implementing such switches if tva viewed it desirable to have that capability]. [insert other restrictions we may be willing to offer up upfront]. affiliates of caledonia recently have successfully negotiated analogous types of operating parameters for a merchant plant that is interconnected with each of ipl and cinergy. caledonia believes that similar types of parameters should be workable in this case. lastly, although not relevant for purposes of tva‰Ûªs review and approval of certain modifications pursuant to section 3.3(c), caledonia further notes that the construction and operation of the modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities and the installation of the southern interconnect should not have an adverse economic effect on tva. caledonia will pay all of the costs and expenses associated with tva‰Ûªs review of any plans, procedures, etc., as may be applicable, that may result from the proposed modifications and the installation and operation of the southern interconnect. moreover, even if caledonia‰Ûªs utilization of the southern interconnect may result in some reduction in the transmission revenues realized by tva from caledonia or the purchasers of power therefrom, we note that in a very analogous circumstance involving a dual interconnect arrangement ‰ÛÓ namely, the batesville plant owned or operated by lsp that is interconnected both with tva and entergy ‰ÛÒ- tva effectively agreed in the interconnect agreement for that plant to waive any otherwise applicable tva transmission charge in the event the plant designates tva as the control area and requests tva to deliver energy from the plant to entergy‰Ûªs transmission system. we are not aware of any fact or circumstance that would justify tva discriminating against caledonia with respect to a very similar dual interconnect arrangement when it clearly has agreed to similar arrangements with other plant owners. please call the udersigned at (713) 853-____ if you have any questions on the foregoing or need any further information. we look forward to working with you to implement the modification to the operating procedures necessary to permit the construction and operation of the modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities and the southern interconnect. very truly yours, capitalized terms used but defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the agreement. approval is not being sought for the diagrams of and specifications for the southern interconnect, but only for the actual modifications to the caledonia interconnection facilities. the southern interconnect is not being installed in order to interconnect and deliver facility electrical output from the facility to tva‰Ûªs transmission system, and therefore, is not included within ‰ÛÏinterconnection facilities,‰Ûù as such term is defined and covered under the terms of the agreement with respect to such approval of diagrams and specifications. however, caledonia will provide tva personnel such access to the facility and the southern interconnect as tva may request pursuant to section 3.10 of the agreement for the purposes set forth therein. probably would omit this sentence relating to section 7.1. need to discuss whether we want to mention this other situation. are there facts we don‰Ûªt know that could hurt our use of it as an analogous circumstance; for e.g., with respect to the ‰ÛÏfree‰Ûù transmission of power to the entergy system?

comments of enron canada corp. on the proposed amendments to the retail settlements code the board‰Ûªs letter of july 23, 2001 regarding self-certification was addressed only to the licensed electricity distributors in the province. however, other classes of licensed market participants, such as retailers, have a legitimate and substantial interest in the market readiness process and the timing of market opening. retailers such as enron canada corp. have invested heavily in the development of the business processes, information systems and supply arrangements necessary to support participation in the ontario retail electricity market. unlike licensed distributors, retailers cannot recover the cost of any of these investments until the market opens. accordingly, enron canada assumes that the fact that the board‰Ûªs letter was addressed to distributors only was not meant to preclude consideration by the board of submissions by other stakeholders, such as retailers, with a legitimate and substantial interest in the issues raised by the board‰Ûªs letter. enron canada is very disappointed by the board‰Ûªs proposal to delay the filing date for the second self-certification report from august 14, 2001 to december 14, 2001. that disappointment is undoubtedly shared by many stakeholders. the board‰Ûªs proposal is evidently based on the board‰Ûªs assessment of the self-certification reports delivered by distributors on july 6, 2001. however, neither those reports nor the data therein has yet been made public. enron canada submits that, in the absence of the public release of those reports and the board‰Ûªs assessments thereof, no stakeholder can be expected to comment on the need for or propriety of the proposed four month delay. in order to comment on the proposed delay, stakeholders reasonably need answers to the following questions: what are the particular facts that led the board to determine that a four month delay was necessary? which distributors indicated that they will be ready on time? which distributors indicated that they will not be ready on time? in what areas of system development are the distributors behind schedule? what steps have been taken by the board and the board‰Ûªs consultants to assess the accuracy of the self-certification reports? assuming the accuracy of the self-certification reports, what steps remain to be taken by the distributors, the board and others (i.e. ebt developers) to complete retail system development? what confidence is there that distributors and others will take the steps necessary to meet the proposed new deadline for the stage 2 self-certification filing? what steps is the board prepared to take to address any non-compliance with the proposed new deadline for stage 2 self-certification? what contingency plans has the board developed or will the board develop in order to allow the market to open in accordance with the government‰Ûªs announced deadline for opening the market ‰ÛÏby may 2002‰Ûù, even though some distributors may not comply with the proposed new deadline for the stage 2 self-certification filing? what ‰ÛÏminimum conditions‰Ûù must be satisfied in order for the board to determine that the retail market is ready (i.e. what number of distributors, representing what proportion of consumers, must be ready)? 5. as matters stand, the proposed delay in the deadline for stage 2 self-certification will further erode the credibility of the ontario restructuring process among those who have committed significant resources to ontario and who are contemplating the commitment of further resources. the successful transition to and operation of the new competitive environment depends to a large extent on continuing investment and commercial activity by entities such as enron canada and other retailers. ontario cannot expect such entities to stay interested in and continue to commit resources to the province‰Ûªs electricity sector in the absence of strong assurances that the outstanding issues in the retail sector will be resolved quickly and that further delay in attaining retail market readiness will not be tolerated. 6. the board‰Ûªs letter indicates that, in early august, the board will issue jointly with the imo a revised market readiness plan. the preparation and publication of that revised market readiness plan presents a real opportunity to bolster the credibility of the restructuring process. on the wholesale side, the imo‰Ûªs uncoupled odr was an outstanding success. on the retail side, the information in the stage 1 self-certification reports should give the board and stakeholders a clearer indication of what work remains to be done. accordingly, the revised market readiness plan should do the following: identify the outstanding issues; set out a clear plan and timetable for addressing those issues; confirm what the consequences (penalties, etc.) will be for those market participants who do not meet the self-certification and other deadlines; clarify what minimum conditions must be satisfied in order to attain market readiness at the wholesale and retail levels; clarify what contingency plans the board and the imo have developed or will develop in order to allow the market to open, even though some market participants may not be ready; and set out a firm date for the opening of the ontario wholesale and retail markets. 7. enron canada looks forward to working with the board, the imo and other stakeholders to ensure that the ontario electricity market opens as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than the ‰ÛÏby may 2002‰Ûù deadline set by the government. aleck dadson senior director, government affairs enron canada corp. 1100 ‰ÛÒ 70 york street toronto, on m5j 1s9 tel: 416 865 3707 fax: 416 865 3766 e-mail: "

 today, enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. here's an update of what we discussed during the call. we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses. it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation: -- in hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. those include investments in azurix, india and brazil. they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments; -- because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and -- on top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-k filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings. we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review. core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. they're our competitive advantage. these include: -- natural gas pipeline businesses; -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe; -- retail businesses in north america and europe; and -- coal businesses in north america and europe. the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. it's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002. i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. according to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships. non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. we have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal. we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. we already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. they include ceg rio, a gas ldc in brazil; ecoelectrica, a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india. the approximately $2.9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals. businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation. reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. more information will follow as soon as it becomes available. credit rating/10-q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: -- moody's at baa3 under review for further downgrade -- fitch at bbb- evolving status -- s&p at bbb- creditwatch negative we also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including osprey, marlin and yosemite, in further detail. we told investors that we will file our 10-q five days late due to our current activities. it will be filed on nov. 19. we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. the full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next few days. it will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under sec filings. in connection with the proposed transactions, dynegy and enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the securities and exchange commission. investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron, without charge, at the sec's web site at www.sec.gov. copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: investor relations, dynegy inc., 1000 louisiana, suite 5800, houston, tx 77002, phone: (713) 507-6466, fax: (713) 767-6652; or investor relations, enron corp., enron building, 1400 smith street, houston, tx 77002, phone: (713) 853-3956, fax: (713) 646-3302. in addition, the identity of the persons who, under sec rules, may be considered participants in the solicitation of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an sec filing under schedule 14a made by each of dynegy and enron.

 enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world. some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in. while not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities. in all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business. primary responsibility for enron corp. security resides in our business controls organization. you can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email john brindle, senior director, business controls, leads this organization. please feel free to provide john and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats. we have two areas to update you on: changes in the access procedures for the enron center campus in houston and changes to our travel advisory. access to the enron center over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the enron center (and other facilities where practical): åá as employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the enron center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer. åá employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture id to obtain access to the enron center (u.s. driver's license, u.s. or foreign passport, or some form of u.s. federal, state or local identification). åá visitors to the enron center must produce a valid photo id when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card. adult visitors without a valid photo id (u.s. driver's license, u.s. or foreign passport, or some form of u.s. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the enron center. åá visitors to enron facilities must be escorted by an enron employee or badged contractor at all times. åá visitors to the enron center will be met in the lobby by an enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment. at the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor. åá employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing tail gating by others. these will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at enron. we ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby. as we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease. we hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. travel advisory update with the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations: åá while the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the middle east be avoided. we continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to afghanistan, yemen, pakistan, indonesia, iran, iraq, sudan, somalia, tajikistan, turkmenistan, georgia, and the kyrgyz republic be canceled. in addition, we recommend that planned travel to egypt, israel, gaza/west bank, jordan, lebanon, saudi arabia, syria, and algeria be very carefully considered. åá for non-u.s. citizens traveling in the united states, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation. there have been several recent reports of non-u.s. citizens who reside in the united states being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding u.s. domestic flights. as a result, we suggest that all non-u.s. citizens who currently reside in the united states - and who do not have permanent resident alien status - carry their passport, form i-94 and form i-797 at all times. we would also suggest that permanent resident aliens carry their permanent resident (green) card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure. it appears that immigration officials may be applying a section of the immigration and nationality act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her registration documentation with them at all times. this can include a permanent resident card, form i-94 card, employment authorization card, border crossing card, or a temporary resident card. immigration officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status. we will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the corporate security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

 brenda was a test. stratego failed. this email is yet more evidence. the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least. the fact that you are still representing makes me sad. asking for props? please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established. don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches. take a moment and peer inside - that tinge of guilt? that's what i'm talking about. in any case, i don't plan on claiming anyone again.

 today we announced the appointment of jeff mcmahon as enron's chief financial officer. in my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of enron. he is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. andy fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. jeff had been serving as chairman and ceo of enron industrial markets. he joined enron in 1994 and spent three years in the london office as chief financial officer for enron's european operations. upon returning to the u.s., jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for enron corp. in 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of enron net works. i know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. i am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. appointing jeff as cfo is one important step in that process. but most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. the fundamentals of our business are strong, and i think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. please join me in giving jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
